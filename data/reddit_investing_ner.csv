t3_qwth1y|1637252851.0|investing|Rather than comparing P/E to History, Compare Earnings Yields to Treasury Yields|"S&amp;P 500 forward price to earnings ratios are at the highest they've been since the tech bubble. This may lead to the question- are we in a bubble?

One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities.

Historically, the S&amp;P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate.

https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf

This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&amp;P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield.

Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&amp;P500 earnings yield prior to the crash.

The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing.

Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. 

Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%,  future earnings are worth very close to present earnings.

With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings!

On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. 

When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings.

Personally, my portfolio is tilted very high towards value stocks and profitable stocks. I hold Fidelity Large Cap Value and Fidelity Small Cap value, and Fidelity Real Estate, as well as VYM and VIG as an indirect way to factor tilt towards profitable stocks.

Of course, stocks always carry market risk. A recession can drive a crash due to lower earnings, as it did in 2009, and in 2020. If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities."|1.0|3.0|0.0|3.0|['Tesla', 'Fidelity Large Cap Value', 'Roblox', 'Nvidia', 'Fidelity', 'VIG', 'Intel', 'Rivian', 'VYM', 'AMD', 'Lucid Motors', 'Fidelity Real Estate']

I decided to take a quick look at the company.  Their Vehicle is... not very impressive, no groundbreaking range, efficiency or price improvements.  Their big selling point is solar cells plastered all over the vehicle, which many companies are exploring.  

You can learn more about the company here:  [https://sonomotors.com/](https://sonomotors.com/)

But, who exactly is building these cars?  Surely a startup this size can't mass produce $30,000 vehicles.  The answer is National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS).  They bought SAAB's assets in 2012 with the intent to make a SAAB 9-3 EV.  In almost a decade, no vehicle has made it to production.  

It gets worse.  NEVS is a subsidiary of China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, A subsidiary of Evergrande Health Industry Group, who bought 100% of NEVS in 2020.  Evergrande Health is, of course, a subsidiary Evergrande Group.  Also of note, NEVS haven't filed any reports since 2019.

t3_qwrgj1|1637247274.0|investing|Covered calls tips and questions?|"Just a few questions that I'm still confused about, here are some questions that I still have, if you know any or all, thanks in advance!





1. Do I need to buy 100 stocks on 1 price for example if xyz stock is at 1 dollar, I need 100 of them to place a covered call? Because of FIFO? I have 100 but each priced and dated at different value (97 98 99).






2. If the strike price is 1 and the person exercise his right for whatever reason at 0.99, you lose your 100 shares because he bought them?






3. Why is there an option strike price lower than your bought share or currently at, if you bought 100 shares at 1 dollar, there's a covered call for 0.50, if you did this, would it be sold? Isn't that a put? 





4. When the contract is about to expire, do you need to care if it expires rather it is in the money or not? For example, it's at 1.01 and your strike price is 1 and the person lets say forgot about it and it expires, are they automatically sold since it reached the price at expire? 





5. Any stocks are best to do covered calls on? That isn't expensive, just want to try on low cost for now, and which type of stock do you look for that seems promising, so far I know the more volumes the better!





6. If you entered a strike price that is practically impossible but it still has a bid ask value, when you place the order to open, no one can take the offer so your contract just useless?"|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|[]

Is this a political move by Erdogan? I do not have a great understanding of Turkish politics, however, Erdogan does not seem to be well liked by Turkish people I know and this decision seems irrational.

Originally a small company with roots in the San Diego area, SIRC now operates in about 40 states after acquiring several subsidiaries at a rapid pace over the past 12 months. These acquisitions include Enerev, a solar sales company; Plemco, an electric vehicle charging company that bids for government contracts and has recently entered the residential space; Cornerstone Construction, a successful multi-state roofing company with ties to the broader roofing and contractor industry SIRC is aiming to synergize with at the national level; Future Home Power, a door-to-door solar sales company headed by Jason Newby, the all-time leading salesperson at Vivant; Balance Claims, which will handle all back-office matters for SIRC; and USA Solar Networks, a solar sales network operating in dozens of states, headed by solar industry veteran Pablo Diaz. The CEO of SIRC is David Massey.

Some of the main business activities of SIRC include: selling solar projects to residential and commercial customers; installing solar projects; supplying solar panels to other companies, such as Solectrac and Healixa; and installing electric vehicle charging stations.

SIRC posted revenue of about $10 million for the quarter ending August 31, 2021, up from about $5 million a year earlier. The company has been expressing expectations of earning over $20 million during the summer months (quarter three), with the hope of achieving $100 million annual revenue in 2022. In addition to looking forward to the numbers for quarters three and four, we as investors are optimistic that even higher revenues are possible over time given the tailwinds, governmental and cultural, lining up behind green energy, and the recent track record of expansion SIRC's team has laid down.

Still trading on the OTC Pinks, SIRC recently completed an audit of its subsidiaries acquired through early 2021, which will allow them to apply for uplisting to the OTCQB exchange in the near future. The company's stated goal is to eventually uplist to the Nasdaq.

The outstanding common shares of SIRC are 430,000,000, with 500,000,000 total authorized. Shares have been used to fund the acquisitions the company was making in 2020 and especially 2021. Management has communicated that new share issuances should be kept to a minimum going forward, and that the focus now is on creating cohesion and growth among the various subsidiaries. Another stated goal, profitability, was informally announced as having been achieved in September 2021. Arbiter Bank recently invested $42 million in SIRC, which we think speaks to the investability of the company. Dutchess Capital, an advising firm for smaller publicly traded companies that are expanding and looking to uplist, has taken SIRC on as a client.

SIRC's share price has been volatile over the past year. After trading under $.10 for most of 2020, the price began to rise at year's end and catapulted up to $3.00 in short order in February 2021. It declined consistently after that, ultimately to about $.30, but has jumped back up to around $.50, which has served as a rough support zone throughout much of this year. Polaris Small Cap Research recently released a report with price targets for SIRC ranging from $1.50 to $3.00.

Concerns regarding SIRC may include: low-penny debt notes held by early investors with an interest in profit-taking; past delays in the audit and uplisting process; the competition and evolving climate in the solar and EV industries.

It's worthy to note that SIRC will be changing their name to better fit the company as they are far from only doing Solar roof installs now, there is a poll in the discord as to what the name should be.

Why I am attracted to this stock can be found in my previous post here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/qsewj2/sirc\_solar\_and\_ev\_charging\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/qsewj2/sirc_solar_and_ev_charging_play/)

t3_qw013h|1637158029.0|investing|Rivian - Is this the right time to buy?|"Electric vehicle maker Rivian became the second-largest IPO in US history on Wednesday by raising an estimated $12 Billion. It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

 It was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&amp;D occurring in-house.  

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

**Products**  

Rivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

&gt;R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven—part truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)  
Rivian's R1T is not just the first battery-powered light-duty pickup, it's also just a really good truck - [CNET](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcFuwyAQRL8m3GyxhGD3wKGX_oaFYe2g2NiFdSz367tOeipCLEgzmtHDO8JxyYclLCTWpVBHx4o24V4mJMIstoK5i8GKYGWjfNOLWLohI84uTlasWz9F7ygu6VRdG5AGxN2atjUe_Q2NasF9yMH4YUCn-wbAG9m8w9wWIiaPFp-YjyWhmOydaC2X6-dFffHe9732Can2y8zPvLhQ7svO17MjDyWVqnJ8RpeqDFThhJ5y9BXlzT-qIeZCVWABVhmfEU-riJZtwMuAAnn7qFVtwOumBR0G0FopU9P3nVr5gxct5xHqsvWFnH-cRUS2s8sPpIKJ4sxHPXEAK8eTykvCYDqe85YiHR0m108YLJdCQW_cL4LdiAkzf0PoHFkw10YabYwE84eIoWotQSsjBXcIC7vS__hfRkCbtg)

But not all reviews have been positive:

&gt;Even if the R1T does prove rugged and reliable, I have yet to see any evidence that the core of America’s truck-loving customers will be taken by its altruistic promise - [Bloomberg](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUcuOwyAM_JpyI8KEJemBw172NyIeboqaQBacRt2vX7K9LbL8QGN7NPaWcM7lZQgrsS1Xmui1oUl41AWJsLC9YpliMCwYMUg_OBbrdCuIq42LYdvulugtxZxOVD-A0MDuxiPAh3QgvbrBdeyD06rVOA4OeqH1e5ndQ8Tk0eATyysnZIu5E2310n9e5Fez4zg6t-S8Oixz5_Pa_k52LdhC0S94plJI4OLK5diKEp_RJl6AeMFnxIPjgp5K9DymGdMe6cXdTjzkxJvHDVPgLY_Eb7nwI5cHi-ac2Z4GCeLj2slOg1fDCCrcQCkpdUffdxrFD16UWGfo6u4qWf84WbJiVlseSBUTxbW5bonPEzmfuv1BmnRTi-ueGqEJk3ULBkNlR0bvg_xpPDXKWNqhwmTJgO4HoZXWAvTwFrHJrpQAJbVgjUPIrSv9X_8L24emwg)

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‘Adventure Network’) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers. 

**Investors &amp; Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian’s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology. 

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

&gt;Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to.. 

**Delivery goals &amp; Challenges**

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.  

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

I am looking into three stocks which includes [Fortitude Gold](https://www.fortitudegold.com/) (FTCO). They are a small producer but a good thing about them is that they have no debts. They recently increased their dividend by 14%, and reported positive results in their Golden Mile property.

I included [Three Valley Copper](https://www.threevalleycopper.com/) (TVC) since they’re showing great potential too.

I honestly think not. I think due to QE and Fed bolstering there is so much cash sloshing around looking for a home that anything with an even remote prospect of return is instantly invested in.

Hear me out. I really think this is a new paradigm, not as in oh market goes up forever and this time is different, and more as in this amount of QE and stimulus mixed with bare bones low interest rate has never been achieved before. We have never had a market with the combination of those 2.

So here's how I see things going forward:

1. Dumb money is here to stay. There's just too damn much of it flooding the market looking for a home. 

2. Retail investor sentiment has changed. No one is risk-adverse on a broad scale anymore. Investors are willing to hold through dips and plunge more cash into them.

3. Interest rates are rock bottom, and there's the possibility they stay that way or go negative due to debt implications if they're raised.

What's going to change? Is retail suddenly going to become risk adverse? Is the amount of capital flooding the system going to be reigned in? Are interest rates going to drastically rise, if at all?

I don't think so. I quite literally think that given market conditions and sentiment a correction is not even possible. Do all the remind me's you want. The market is unable to correct."|0.77|71.0|0.0|71.0|['QE']

Earlier this week, Chinese news site Callanish reported that many bondholders had received interest payments from three bond tranches that owed **a total of more than $148 million in interest payments due last month but had a grace period that ended on Wednesday.**

Because they were not authorized to speak to the media, the source declined to be identified. A request for comment from Evergrande was not returned.

Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, has been missing deadlines in recent weeks as it deals with **more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are international market bonds.**

Failure to pay would have resulted in the company's formal default and triggered cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar debts, aggravating the world's second-largest economy's debt problem.

Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed shares had risen more than 9% by mid-morning on the news that the latest deadline had been reached. A financial crisis has weighed on the sector, threatening hundreds of projects, and the corporation, which also has **coupon payments totaling more than $255 million due on December 28**, has come under strain.

The market is also keeping an eye on rival **Kaisa Group**, which has $59 million in coupon payments due on Thursday and Friday. After Evergrande, Kaisa has the biggest offshore debt of any Chinese developer. Kaisa, which has missed a payment on a wealth management product, was **downgraded by S&amp;P to “CCC-” from “CCC+” with a negative outlook on Thursday**, following a similar action by Moody’s.

The rating agency said Kaisa’s liquidity appears to be depleted, and it expects a default scenario is inevitable within the next six months. China’s property woes have rattled global markets since September despite Beijing’s efforts to reassure markets the crisis would not be allowed to spiral out of control. Regulators and government think-tanks have held meetings with developers in the past few weeks, and the market is expecting some easing in credit and housing policies to prevent a hard landing of the sector.

I received the points 2-3 months ago. I haven't used the points for anything and currently have 109,314 points in chase rewards. This equals $1,093.14 if redeemed for statement credit or deposited into a bank account. If redeemed this amount through Chase Ultimate Rewards for travel for the 1.25X points value this increases the value to $1,366.42.

I was planning on saving these points for a vacation or travel that is not a vacation. I've been thinking the last couple of weeks that it would make more sense for me to move the points value to an investment account, but haven't done it yet because I still have been contemplating using these points for travel since it's 25% more value. A couple of days ago I decided I will move this money into an investment account unless someone can give me a reason not to.. If I moved this money to an investment account back in roughly August or September into VTI I could be up approximately 7-8% already. If invested in NVDA (been investing in a brokerage for NVDA so I picked that for this) I could have been up \~55% to \~$1,694.

I am 26 and the future is more important than now so it would make more sense to invest it.. I haven't done the math until writing this post, for that I realize I am answering my own post in that it makes more sense to invest this money than to redeem it for travel. I am not trying to break rule #2, I am just trying to get advice on what thoughts are for investing it vs using the points, if I break #2 sorry. 

Not stating my personal situation, I am just asking if others have done this before and what seems to be better. I am going to deposit my chase credit card bonus points/money equivalent into my Roth IRA or HSA unless someone has advice on that it would be better enjoyment-wise to use it for vacation or travel in the short term.."|0.62|6.0|0.0|6.0|['Chase Ultimate Rewards']

As the market goes up they raise their stop price. 

However, I was wondering how this would work if the market is closed, or if the circuit breakers kick in, and when the market re-opens the prices are all well below their limit/stop price. 

For example, lets say the Dow closes at 36,000 and some terrible news event occurs overnight there might be no way people would be able to exit their positions at 36,000. They wlll have to sell after the market opens right? And the market wil open much lower than 36,000.  

Also, if word gets out that certain investors were able to sell, while retail investors were unable to get their orders filled this could lead to a full scale revolt.

The fact that he's trying to cash out shows he thinks it's near peak and about to go down.

From what I understand, if I happen to make close to or above a certain amount annually from my full time job, then that will either reduce or zero out my contribution ability.

Let’s say I make 60k this year and started contributing to the Roth IRA and everything is good. But then I get a new a job next year that makes over 150k. According to the IRS, as a single, my allowed contribution amount then would be zero. So what would happen to my account and the total amount of contributions/investments/earnings that I already have acquired? I don’t lose it or anything like that right?

Another question that I have is: Is a Roth IRA connected to a specific job or company that I work for in any way or is it simply an Individual/on your own thing? Going off of the above example, if I happen to get a new job, I don’t have to create another Roth IRA for that job/company right?

When VIX is high, there is high anxiety in the market and the market turns bearish. When VIX is low, there is low anxiety in the market and the market turns bullish.

It has a negative correlation with SPY. In other words, when SPY goes up, VIX goes down and vice versa. Only once was there an instance when both VIX (anxiety) and SPY (S&amp;P 500 performance) were high but that seems to be an outlier.

Over the last 12 years it seems the 08' recession and the 2021 pandemic were the only points of significant anxiety in the market with low anxiety in between as the VIX indicator returns to the mean, even during 2021.

No one can predict the future and I'm only guessing here but it seems like a time span of 10 years seems to be the average for the market to take a huge hit, only for VIX to go down and SPY going up shortly after such an event occurs.

In the past, valuations and fundamentals have mattered because the big institutions and the average retail investor thought they mattered. Even algos, which on some level were active at the onset of the 80's were programmed and directed to sell off stock when the valuation became too absurd. 

But when I look at the Rivians and Nikolas of the world I start to think maybe they're just a symptom of the larger mentality of the market, including institutions, including the algos that are programmed by humans that have normal human biases.

Theoretically, if the larger consensus of the market.. from institutions to retail to the programmers making algos, was that only future potential growth mattered and nothing else, wouldn't that theoretically mean that only growth and hype stocks would have growth and interest forever? 

I mean on a purely theoretical level, if we reached a point where it was a consensus by the vast majority of investors from all levels and backgrounds was that speculation and growth wins the day, wouldn't the market reflect that?

What I mean to say is the market can be a reflection of the risk appetite of the broad spectrum of humans investing and trading in it, and if that were to slowly shift would it be possible that value stocks or old blue chips are largely forgotten forever, or have a bad return versus hype/speculation/growth moving forward?

If no one is a Warren Buffett anymore, why would Warren Buffett-esque stocks have any market beating returns? No one would invest in them (on a level compared to hype/speculation stocks). They'd just theoretically sit there at low valuations forever paying out dividends and what not, with their only real growth being from stock buy backs.

But is 2030 the best time to sell? Will Tesla yoy growth justify its stock growth?

Tesla doesn't have a demand problem cause it sells every car it makes, so their main problem is their supply capacity.

So this analysys is based on the Utopia principle that Tesla will have enough demand until 2030 and that it will grow at a 40% rate. And that it will be able to build their factories in 12 months without any geopolitical problem and with swift negotiation with the goverments of all the countries. And with the asumption that Tesla suppliers will be able to grow at a similar rate and that all the copper/alum/etc mines will be able to satisfy the demand.

**Important data**

Elon said that they will search where to build more factories in 2022 and that they will announce the location in 2023.

The calculation is based on the premise that the factories will be built in 12 months and that they will be able to go at max output instantly. Elon said that they will increase their max output of the factories by 50% next year, so in the calculation in the 1st year the factories will have a max output of 500.000 cars and in the next 750.000.

**Result: Supply doesnt meet the demand**

&amp;#x200B;

This shows that in 2030 Tesla wont be able to grow at a 40% rate unless it builds more factories than in this analysis. In the case that Tesla announces a lower number of factories in the next years vs the analysis then their supply wont meet the demand sooner.

In my opinion Tesla is more than capable to built 3-4 factories at the same time, the main problem would be the lack of human resources, regulatory problems like in Germany, negotiation issues, etc, all external problems that Tesla cant do anything about them.

Internal problems like a lack of money for the new factories are not an issue for Tesla. 

One main advantage that Tesla has is that they can make the new factory better than the last one, so in 2030 they could need less factories to meet the demand by making each factory produce close to 1M like they aim to do in Fremont, this would offset any external problem like in Germany.

**And this is where i ask for help: Has any automaker be able to built 5 factories at the same time? or any other industrial company? Apple, BYD?**

In my opinion Tesla is a safe bet until 2025, then we will need to reevaluate it, cause predicting 9 years ahead is just guessing, anything can happen.

**In my opinion BYD is the main threat to Tesla. And Starlink is the main threat to Tesla stocks cause even tesla investors will sell some shares and stop buying to buy Starlink shares when it goes public in 5 years.**"|0.35|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Tesla', 'Amazon', 'Elon', 'Apple', 'BYD', 'Starlink']

Avoiding tax traps?|"As an American/Canadian dual citizen living in Canada, it seems like there's quite a few traps I need to avoid.  I'm essentially starting to save for my retirement.  I'm young, don't need this money to survive, and I'm looking for maximum growth, so I believe 100% equity ETFs are my thing.

But because I'm a dual citizen living in Canada, it seems I've shot myself in the foot.  My income accrued in Roth IRA would be taxed by the CRA and the income accrued in a TFSA would be taxed by the IRS.  Great, so I can't use either of these great options.  

I also may move back to the U.S. at some point in my life and I haven't even begun to plan on how that may affect the choices I make now in terms of departure tax on all my investments.  In addition to that I need to navigate foreign withholding tax.  

It seems as though my best option is to buy US listed ETFs that hold US stocks, specifically though an RRSP.  This would allow me to avoid foreign withholding tax.  Otherwise if I purchased US listed ETFs holding US stocks like Vanguard's VOO in a non-registered account, I'd pay the 15% withholding tax, but I could recover this from my Canadian taxes, and I could use recovered amount to just buy more US listed ETFs, sort of making this moot, but it's just an extra hassle.  Is my understanding correct?  

If I'm understanding this correctly, I'm basically stuck using the old style retirement accounts where I'm taxed when I make withdrawals in retirement.  That sucks.

Is this my best course of action to minimize tax losses and maximize growth for retirement?"|0.59|3.0|0.0|3.0|['CRA', 'IRS', 'Vanguard']

What the ever loving fuck. 

So what exactly is going on here? 

Here’s my theory, and I’ll preface this by saying I’m not a crypto expert, but I am the owner of a large PR firm, and I’ve seen the underbelly of how media works.

What’s happening here is that we are witnessing the extraordinary power of meme based communities centered around highly memeable content. The power comes from two places.

1. The meme creates very strong in-group dynamics. Look no further than the popularity of meme based (not memecoin) based subreddits. Memes spread like wildfire even when financial incentive isn’t involved. This creates hyper active communities that build strong ties extremely quickly.

2. Memes themselves are viral loops. Any community user creating memes is a potential source of new virality for the meme, or memecoin. This is an exponential flywheel and this is what most miss.

As these groups ramp up, you inevitably get people with media power joining, including journalist with big audiences.

This seems to be happening with dogebonk and perhaps a few others.

The memecoin market is an insane Wild West, and everyone should fully expect them all to potentially be scams. 

That said, we already know the proliferating power of memes, so to expect memecoins to not be able to leverage that huge power, is to be blind to the clown world crypto enabled."|0.89|1239.0|0.0|1239.0|[]

WSJ recently wrote an article about it, you can easily find an article if you are interested.

I hear the same again and again: ""anyone can do a job of an average financial advisor"". Below is a story of a person from the industry.

&gt;We had a group of 5 mutual funds and our decision to decide what fund to put them in was based on one question: “on a scale of 1-5, what is your risk tolerance”. We asked every single client this and based on their answer plus their age, income and savings we put them in one of those  
&gt;  
&gt;I thought even a monkey could do my job at first but was amazed how many clients wouldn’t invest at all and just had their money sitting in cash. I wondered how even without an advisor why people couldn’t/wouldn’t pick pretty much any mutual fund and put their money there  
&gt;  
&gt;I got paid based on how much I got people to invest and thought it would be easy money to convince people to make their assets grow but it was damn hard. Most clients had money in a CD and would refuse to move it

The strain on supply has led to longer wait times and spiking prices for consumers. One research firm estimates that the cost of an average ride-share trip has jumped 92% from Jan. 2018 to July 2021.

Driver capacity was down around 40% last quarter. And the ride-hailing giants are investing heavily in driver wage and benefit increases to incentivize them to return to the platforms. In Q2, Lyft increased its investments in incentives 92% quarter over quarter to roughly $375 million to attract more drivers.

Here are what analysts are projecting for both companies:

# Uber

According to projections from 44 analysts, Uber has a consensus **rating of Strong Buy**, with a **rating score of 4.3/5**. The consensus average1-year revenue growth estimate is 45.89%, and the earnings growth estimate is 26.74%. The current market price is $ 45.12 while the 1-year average price target is $ 68.01 - that represents a 50.73% upside potential.

AMZN 1.52% warehouse employees in the New York City borough of Staten Island have withdrawn their petition with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election at four company warehouses, a labor board spokeswoman said Friday. 

 The fledgling union, which calls itself the Amazon Labor Union, said it had to withdraw because the labor board, a federal agency that oversees collective bargaining, had communicated that it no longer had adequate support to move forward with an election.

  To meet the requirement, unions typically have to collect signatures from 30% of workers showing support. The change came after many workers who had shown support for a union left the company, according to Chris Smalls, a former Amazon employee who leads the group. He said the union planned to collect more signature cards and refile for an election.  “As soon as we can get enough cards, we’ll resubmit,” he said. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company’s focus “remains on listening directly to our employees and continuously improving on their behalf.”

 The union push in New York is the biggest challenge to Amazon of organized labor since a failed unionization effort earlier this year in Alabama.  It also represents another battle for Amazon at its New York hub. In 2018, Amazon had selected the city as part of its so-called “HQ2’’ development around the same time union leaders had been rallying support for workers to unionize on Staten Island. The union effort fizzled out, though Amazon also abandoned its HQ2 plans in New York.

This mention was from a live Twitter chat today with CEO Alan Knitowski. Yesterday they reported positive earnings for the first time since 2018.

Anyway, because I haven’t had the time to do a write-up on today’s interview, the following is my writeup of a a Benzinga interview with Phunware COO Randall Crowder and Board Member Ryan Costello from *last week*. It’s a written explanation of the business and its goals based on that interview, along with quotes from the two:

Phunware is a mobile platform that allows people to monetize their data (whether political data for politicians or marketing data for companies) with native cryptocurrency to engage with politicians/companies in a decentralized way, allowing users to “voluntarily opt-in” to the use of their data. This allows constituents/consumers to monetize their verifiable data on a blockchain in order to reflect their interests to candidates/companies, and this helps them produce more connected campaigns or more satisfactory consumer goods/services. Politicians are incentivized to pay for political data because it is the backbone of winning any campaign, and constituents are incentivized to engage with their politicians to have their views reflected. Same goes for consumers and the businesses that require their revenue to survive.

Phunware seeks to compete with traditional advertising—particularly social media—by redefining how constituents engage with their politicians. The Trump 2020 campaign was planning to outsource their data intelligence to Salesforce, but campaign insider Brad Parscale recognized the reality that this company was the only company that could do so. At that time they were managing all of Fox News’ mobile applications.

 “If you want the Trump experience, we can do that right now for you…What you can do in the real world is things like rallies, events.” 

“Come for the meme, stay for the company.”

“What Trump is trying to do is disruption. It’s dis-intermediating the middle man, and I think that’s what people in their soul just do not feel comfortable with. That’s probably the greatest threat to our democracy, is the prevention of the fair exchange of ideas.”

“50% revenue guidance in Q3, 100% revenue guidance in Q4.”

“At the time [we began working with Trump] we were managing all of Fox’s [News] entire mobile ecosystem. You have a company that can buy and build anything they want, and their outsourcing to Phunware.”

—COO Randall Crowder

—

“The constant engagement with constituents and voters is the difference between winning and losing.”

“There is not confidence that you get full participation on social media platforms…and the objective is frankly to push through those algorithms,”

“It’s not just political candidates, it’s issue advocacy organizations and associations that highly value this type of engagement.”

“Don’t try to convince a voter why you’re right, find a voter where they are.”

There is merit to a marketplace of property though. There isn't a regulated exchange for collectables in America. We have the NYSE for stocks, CME for commodities, but we don't have one to trade collectable/non fungible items. Because such a thing doesn't exist, blockchain based marketplaces are filling the void for that niche in the meantime. I think the preferred medium is a regulated exchange where real people are KYC'd and vetted before pushing an auction to sale. The obvious advantage of it is that governments will recognize property rights of the sales.

t3_qrtkox|1636660676.0|investing|Understanding and Profiting from our Current Inflationary Environment|"Inflation is a persistent issue coming out of the COVID lockdown economy and continues to create a great amount of confusion for the retail investor space. Many retail traders don't know what it means or how to respond. More specifically, many are having trouble with tailoring their portfolios to either avoid risk or take advantage of inflationary circumstances. I aim to somewhat remedy this. I hope the pointers below will help you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. This is not the end all or be all and I welcome your observations and comments on what I could have missed. Enjoy this and lets make some money taking advantage of these once in a lifetime economic circumstances.

* **Inflations is Measured by a Change in Rate:** Inflation doesn't usually go down. The RATE of inflation goes up or down, but inflation itself is persistent. This is by design. Could you imagine what would happen to the economy if you knew that your dollar would be worth more tomorrow than it is today? Spending on goods other than necessities would come to a very dramatic reduction (*Note: You might be rethinking crypto right now huh?*). So it is important to understand that what we are looking at is the CHANGE IN RATE of inflation. There is no deflation!! Deflation is 1000x worse for the economy than inflation. So do not expect deflation. The Fed simply will not allow it. Nor should they!
* **Current Inflation is Largely a Result of too Much Demand:** During the COVID lock downs many businesses were forced to grind their operations to a halt. Remember food, toilet paper, &amp; other essentials flying off the shelves? Indeed many grocery stores were limiting the amount of water you could buy. It only stands to reason that when you force businesses to close down you create a situation where the goods that people demand are not being replaced by a steady supply. So what happens as the economy opens back up? Suddenly those same businesses have reduced inventories, they need to hire back workers, they need to order new supplies, &amp; they need to meet an increased demand as a result of some competitors closing their doors for good. Now the quantity of goods demanded well exceeds the quantity of goods supplied ... on all fronts. Reopening firms are competing against other reopening firms for the same raw materials, supplies, resources, shipping, etc. They are also competing for the same labor pool. Remember that goods &amp; services in times of extreme scarcity go to the highest bidder.
* **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand (Or too Little Supply):** Below you will find the inflationary issues we find ourselves in as a result of increased demand and limited supply. Below each topic you will also find some examples of how to profit from each. You will also receive some examples of secondary and tertiary effects of each.
* **Supply Chain Bottlenecks:** First and foremost in the news are the supply chain bottlenecks. We've all seen the ships floating off the Port of Los Angeles, or the very long line of trucks waiting to pick up freight from the ports. The United States &amp; Europe have but a limited number of ports and they're taking on all the supplies that firms ordered as the economy opened back up. Making things worse ... its holiday shopping season. So cost of shipping dry bulk overseas is not just rising as a result of increased demand, but as a result of the fact that it costs money to have all these carriers waiting weeks to offload their goods. Making matters worse many of the imported goods are perishables which can spoil and reduce the supply of foodstuffs amid an already high demand. As a result many firms are opting for alternative methods of shipping like the much more expensive option of air freight.

**(*****Note: Moderately bullish on sea freight carriers, rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**

* **Supply Chain Shortages:** As if the bottlenecks weren't bad enough, there are but a limited number of domestic shipping firms. Firms that not only transport materials to businesses, or, finished goods to retailers, but also delivering orders to retail shoppers. Here we are once again talking about rail, trucking, mail delivery, air freight, logistics firms, logistics outsourcing, etc. So yet again we have an increased demand for shipping and logistics with but a limited supply. And while this demand will keep up for some time, many firms know it will eventually come back down to normal, and therefore, are very hesitant to expand too fast too quickly for fear that they will one day have too much fleet for future business.

**(*****Note: Moderately bullish on rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**

* **Semiconductor Shortages:** Everything these days has a semiconductor. Whether its semiconductors, passive semiconductors, diodes, you name it, chances are if it was an electronic made in the last 5 years, it needs a semiconductor to properly operate. Indeed before the supply chain shortages hit critical mass, we were dealing with semiconductor shortages. Now we will not likely fix the semiconductor issue until we fix the supply chain issue. Once again as the economy opened back up &amp; demand skyrocketed, semiconductors too experienced a complementary spike in demand. Semiconductors alone are preventing the automakers from producing at full capacity. There are not enough semiconductors to make vehicles. And with the holidays on the horizon semiconductors are in higher demand than ever. Even Sony had to reduce the number of PlayStations they could manufacture and ship due to component shortages and logistics issues. So expect the price of any new electronic device that has a semiconductor to increase in price.

**(*****Note: Bullish on electronics &amp; semiconductors*****)**

* **Vehicle Shortages:** As noted with the semiconductors, vehicles are in short supply. As a result the quantity of vehicles demanded exceed the quantity of vehicles supplied. Therefore we not only have a shortage of vehicles but the price o vehicles have skyrocketed. Have you seen the empty lots at your local dealership? There's nothing to sell! People are ordering direct from factory. As a result people turned toward used vehicles which now are also in short supply. As a result people who could not afford the increased price of used vehicles resulted to maintaining their current vehicles. And as a result of people maintaining their current vehicles, the demand for auto parts &amp; auto mechanics have skyrocketed. And I don't know many large firms that do not need a frequent supply of vehicles to maintain operations.

**(Note:** ***Moderately bullish to bullish on used car firms, auto parts, and car repair***\*\*)\*\*

* **Raw Material Shortages:** Raw materials were the first to explode out of COVID. Wood, steel, ore, oil, &amp; minerals ... you name it, its all going up. The quantity of supply demanded exceed the current supply ... and for many reasons.

**(Note:** ***Moderately bullish on miners, steel, mining equipment suppliers, and oil/gas producers ... see energy shortage below for more detail on oil/gas***\*\*)\*\*

* **Increased Demand for Housing:** Largely as a result of low interest rates incentivizing lending, we experienced a housing and construction boom in the middle of a Pandemic. Houses and industrial builds in many areas have skyrocketed in value. But this was not only as a result of low interest rates. When the federal government instituted a ban on evictions from rental properties, many took advantage by simply not paying their rent. The forgone payments to the landlord forced the renter to pass on the costs on to new tenants, which increased the cost of rental properties beyond that just owning a home in many areas. So people bought homes instead. Moreover many people moved out of urban areas to escape burdensome COVID restrictions which furthermore increased the demand of housing. Furthermore lifetime renting millennials saw the low interest rates as a great time to buy their first home. Finally, mortgage forbearance reduced a lot of foreclosures during COVID. Less foreclosures means less supply, less supply amid high demand results in higher prices.

**(Note:** ***Not very bullish on housing &amp; real estate at this time but still moderately bullish on construction, furniture, paint, fixtures, and infrastructure***\*\*).\*\*

* **Energy Shortages:** As we began to put the COVID economy behind us, more people are travelling to work, to school, and going on vacation. More recently international travel is opening back up.  Moreover firms are expanding rapidly to meet demand and shippers are using more energy than ever. This all of course increases the price of oil, natural gas, jet fuel, and the fuel you pay at the pump. Making matters worse, no matter what your politics are, the current administration in the White House is the most ardently unfriendly domestic coal and fossil fuel administrations we've had in 5 years. OPEC, perhaps realizing that such demand will be but temporary for the next 1-2 years, refuses to entertain the Biden administrations request to ramp up oil supply. Oddly enough big oil hasn't been in this good of a position for the last 4 years where the increase of supply made it seriously hard for oil firms to profit. Energy is used for producing everything. When energy goes up the cost of everything goes up. When energy goes up, people spend more on energy and less on other things. So the increase in energy costs are a result of both increased post COVID demand and politics. Of all the issues we are experiencing with inflated prices, energy is among the easiest to fix.

**(Note: B*****ullish on oil, natural gas, oil and natural gas equipment maintainers and suppliers, and perhaps oil exploration if the Biden administration would quit putting up road blocks***\*\*)\*\*

* **Worker Shortages:** ""Worker Shortages"" is misleading. When people think of a ""worker shortage"" they generally think that we don't have enough workers to meet demand. They would be correct. But we should phrase it as ""firms do not have enough workers to meet CURRENT demand."" Lets face it we are rear view looking creatures. Simply because a firm doesn't have enough workers does not indicate that they cant beat previous profit/revenue, but rather they can not only beat previous revenue projections, but also be in a position where they cannot meet CURRENT demand. And just like anything else, when the quantity of labor demanded exceeds the quantity of labor supplied, we run into increased labor costs ... namely wages. And wages are overwhelmingly the highest cost for most firms. 

**(Note:** ***Bullish on staffing and outsourcing firms***\*\*)\*\*

* **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand ... Conclusion:** Lets keep this simple. You want to buy a car. That car is made from raw materials such as aluminum &amp; steel. The car requires electronics. Those electronics require semiconductors. You need a labor force to put that car together. You need energy to manufacture that car. You need truckers &amp; freighters to ship those cars or bring manufacturers the materials to make cars. You need equipment to make cars. In short 100% of the price of all components of that car, or the components used to make that car, have gone up. Still, you have a high demand market where people and businesses require vehicles, but the manufacturer cant meet that demand due to the lack of supplies available. Nevertheless the vehicle manufacturer still needs to pay for overhead costs to keep the doors open. And as so many people are demanding such a short supply of cars, the manufacturers simply increase the price of that car to meet the demand of the highest paying bidders. And this phenomenon is happening in each step of the chain to make that car from the folks who supply the materials, to the folks who produce the energy, to the folks who ship the finished product. When the quantity of goods demanded exceed the quantity of goods supplied, prices necessarily must go up.
* **Monetary Drivers of Inflation:**  As a result of the dramatic initial downward shift in demand amid COVID lockdowns, the Federal Reserve made money cheap, essentially lowering interests rates to both incentivize borrowing and make borrowing more affordable. The result? Massive influxes of borrowing and lending which in turn flooded the economy with cash. At first this excess cash was used to make it through the pandemic. Later this cash was used by firms to expand rapidly to meet demand. People also used cheap money via extremely low interest rates to purchase homes, which increased the demand for housing. Eventually the Fed is going to need to raise interest rates to disincentive lending and cool off a hot economy. If allowed to persist for too long the influx of cash will lead to investments by firms looking to to stave off losing the value of money via inflation and thereby creating a massive bubble. There are already indicators of this happening by virtue of equity valuations in the market. (*Note: the Fed has also been incentivizing investment in the stock market by buying treasury bonds on the secondary market which resulted in keeping the yields artificially low. As a result people were less inclined to buy treasury bonds and more incentivized to invest in other equity*).
* **Government Drivers of Inflation:** The rapid inflation we are experiencing has not deterred President Biden for advocating for trillions in spending measures. The U.S. Government is a customer just like anyone else, and the government competes for the same goods and services you and I do. Increased spending will to some extent result in crowding out the private sector that competes for the same goods and services. Remember that an increase in demand with limited supply generally results increased prices. If the government spends too much, it can seriously hurt consumers in the form of increased prices. Moreover the Biden administration isn't the most friendly administration when it comes to mining for coal, oil, minerals, etc.. This inevitably leads to increased costs of energy and raw materials. (*Note: This comment used a political figure as an example of a negative economic consequence. Do me a favor, take the example for what its worth to you, and realize I am not going to entertain heated political discussion. There is a cost and benefit to everything, and I don't have the time to entertain the talking points you pulled from a political webpage or favorable news site and tell you why you're wrong, when no matter how much the evidence is stacked against you, you're not going to change your mind anyway. Ergo a massive waste of time that benefits no one*).
* **Inflation is Excellent for Debt!:** I will keep this one quick. Lets say you took out a 30 year fixed mortgage in 1990. You paid $90,000 for your home and have a mortgage of $400 per month. In the year 2019 your home is now worth $200,000 in market value but you're still paying $400 per month at a fixed rate. Through inflation your wages have eventually increased while your fixed rate mortgage remained stagnant. In short, you may have been scrimping for pennies when you took out the mortgage, but years later you can make your payment while working at a fast food restaurant. Neat huh? Inflation is excellent for debt ridden companies. As their profit margins increase over time through inflation they will find it much easier to pay off their long term debt. (*Note: Perhaps this put some of the companies you were looking at into better perspective, and if debt was a major factor for not investing, then you may or may not want to revisit your decision.*)
* **Bullish Sectors You Can Profit From that I did not Mention Above:** Industrial Chemicals, Industrial Equipment, Fertilizers, Farm Equipment/Construction, and Pesticides. As firms ramp up production they will increase the demand for industrial chemicals. Moreover, as food prices continue to increase the more land farmers will be incentivized to clear for additional farming which requires more farming construction, farming equipment, chemicals/pesticides, and fertilizers.
* **The Canary in the Inflation Coal Mine:** If the change in prices rise beyond the change in incomes to the point where people need to start economizing their necessities and forgoing their wants, we could be looking at a very serious correction.

**Conclusion:** I hope the pointers above have helped you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. Please understand that I will be reading this over and over again to identify typos &amp; unclear sentences. I may even edit it as people bring ideas to my attention. Anyway I hope you enjoyed it and can turn this into long term investment opportunities."|0.85|379.0|0.0|379.0|['The U.S. Government', 'Sony', 'the Federal Reserve', 'the White House', 'OPEC']

Their timing (mostly by sheer luck) could not have been more perfect. More importantly, they specifically have amassed a huge inventory of what were previously 10-20k cars to appeal to the lower/middle income demographic. This range has appreciated more than any range of used vehicle. We’re talking 50-60% from a couple years ago in many cases. Best part is, used car prices continue to skyrocket as supply shortages and inflation show no signs of retreat. At some point the carousel will stop but until then I think Shift will experience rapid growth and profitability.

Anecdotally, I have heard more and more people talk about buying from Shift, and it’s relative ease compared to Carvana.

Shift is rapidly stealing market share from Carvana, yet is valued at only 600mil to Carvana’s 49Bil valuation. I think Shift has been mainly overlooked since it was part of the recent several-month long de-SPAC slaughter. For whatever it’s worth, last I checked it’s short interest was about 22%.

Shift reports earnings today after market close. I think it’s a nice opportunity.

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later."|0.72|27.0|0.0|27.0|[]

 While economists debate the relative importance of the factors that motivated and perpetuated inflation for more than a decade, there is little debate about its source. 

 The origins of the Great Inflation were policies that allowed for excessive growth in the supply of money—Federal Reserve policies. Sound familiar? 

 Among other things, the act declared it a responsibility of the federal government “to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power” and provided for greater coordination between fiscal and monetary policies. 

 This act is the seminal basis for the Federal Reserve’s current dual mandate to “maintain long-run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates…so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates”

[https://www.simplify.us/etfs/pink-simplify-health-care-etf](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/pink-simplify-health-care-etf)

The  ETF is run by Michael Taylor, a hedge fund manager with a reputation  among hedge fund (health) pods at being one of the best invididual company pickers -  particularly among health/pharma/medtech/biotech. The expense ratio  minus trading/legal fees is also being **donated entirely to charity**,  although at 0.50 it's low for an active ETF. Mike's been running his  hedge fund for over a decade, so this is the first opportunity retail  investors have to take advantage of his management.

My  circumstance also is that I have a bunch of individual holdings in my  personal portfolio, but I need something to round out my health exposure  as I'm nowhere near competent to pick myself in the health space. I've  been slowly adding to PINK and wanted to go a bit into my decision  process on how I choose an active manager. In my case I've been  following Mike on twitter for a while so I already know his strengths:  he is not just good at ""picking stocks"" but he also gets **portfolio construction** and **market cycles**...particularly in the health space.

See ARKG for an example of how **not**  to do portfolio construction. In short, don't go ""all-in"" on a single  factor (i.e. long duration early-stage growth in ARGK's case). Going all  in on a single factor works when it works, but when it doesn't work you  are stuck bag-holding at an inopportune time in the cycle and selling  low to meet outflows. Mixing up the factors helps with regards to moving  capital from whatever is trading expensive (relatively) to whatever is  trading cheaper on a factor basis.

As of this posting, you can see a mix of mega-cap blue chips and concentrated ""bets"" in his top 20.

* **Mega-cap Blue chips**: UNH, PFE, ABT, JNJ, ANTM, LLY, ..
* **Concentrated bets**: DXCM, UTHR, ZTS, HZNP, LIVN, LNTH, ...

Obviously  Mike is going for some individual company alpha with some of the  concentrated bets. There is also an overweight on medtech throughout the  portfolio relative to XLV. IMO this is due to medtech having  under-earned as an industry throughout 2020-2021 and they are likely to  resume normal earnings in 2022.

Similar style...it mixes up innovative/disruptive small/mid cap growth  bets with more conservative holdings. Obviously no relation between PRNHX and PINK but I want to highlight that there are funds that do  really well and then fizzle off, and then there are funds that stand the  test of time. Market cycle &amp; portfolio construction is just as  important as stock picks and that's what most folks don't realize when they chase performance.

Virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse. I daresay these are just the starting points to the entrance to a whole new alternate universe.

AMD has partnerships with Microsoft and Sony for gaming console chips and now has signed up Meta (Facebook) as a new customer. We all know what Facebook was planning when it changed name to Meta and AMD is going to benefit tremendously from this partnership.

It's gradually taking away market share from Intel and soon we will reach a point where Intel might not even be a competitor to AMD. While the need for CPUs is here to stay, most future tech would be based on GPUs, a sector where AMD has a strong footing.

Have a long position in AMD, bought at 115. Would buy more before it hits 200.

Edit: adding a section to explain why GPUs would support future AI and VR tech more than CPUs.

GPUs are better at performing mathematical and geometric calculations than CPUs. That's why they are crucial for AI/ML and VR.
This is also why GPUs are used intensively for crypto mining. 
CPUs are crucial for putting everything together and perform code and logic processing. That's why GPUs won't replace CPUs but as we move towards more complex requirements for altverse, we would need powerful CPUs but we would need much more advanced GPUs. For instance take high end pc games. High end games can run on a mid-end I5 CPU but need a high end GPU.

5. Direct landing (Yieldstreet? Worth checking the fee structure and the underlying products)

I find in particular the ETFs [SPD](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/spd-simplify-us-equity-plus-downside-convexity-etf) and [CYA](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/cya-simplify-tail-risk-strategy-etf) interesting.

[SPD](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/spd-simplify-us-equity-plus-downside-convexity-etf) is basically an S&amp;P500 ETF with partial exposure to put options to hedge against market crashes. So you sacrifice a bit of potential gains in a bull market but actually can make even also make money in a crash. This ETF could be probably used as a big or even as the only part of a portfolio. 

[CYA](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/cya-simplify-tail-risk-strategy-etf) is a hedging ETF probably not intended to be the main part of a portfolio. It's financing through a rather complicated options strategy a short exposure on the stock market by going short on volalility, so basically it tries to position you constantly short on the stock market without losing money in a bull market. In combination with the VOO or other ETFs it could function as a hedging mechanism for the portfolio.

Both ETFs have compared to completely passive ETFs like VOO rather expensive fees of 0.54% and 0.75% but you could argue that it's actually relatively cheap for an actively managed fund. Both ETFs are very new and have basically no track record and I think it's also difficult to back test because of the rather complicated options strategy. 
Of course you could try to replicate these strategies by yourself but it would definitely take time and effort so for some it might be worth it to pay the fees."|0.71|11.0|0.0|11.0|['Simplify']

It posted revenue of $5.5 billion last year, though with relatively modest earnings at $36 million. But they've managed to keep up with reduction in panel prices surprisingly well over the years. Even with declining panel prices, their revenues are growing. Even if solar panels become a commodity, within 5 years it will be the commodity responsible for more than half of new electricity generation capacity. And as long as solar prices don't crash, they could easily pivot to the business of building solar projects, or start selling electricity.

So how does it make any sense that their market cap is roughly HALF of their annual revenue?

Compare that to TSLA at about 35x the revenue multiple. In the same industry, SPWR is at 5x the revenue multiple. Chinese electric car manufacturer, NIO, it's also trading at around 5x the revenue multiple, and it's not profitable.

t3_qpe2gt|1636379546.0|investing|IMO the market is strongly underestimating the magnitude of rate hikes required to temper inflation|"Across the new sources I read, the consensus seems to be that the market is pricing in the first rate hike around Summer 22. The magnitude of the expected rate hike is tiny, maybe a quarter-percent. If you are of the belief that supply-chain shortages will last well into 2022, this is hilariously inadequate.

First, we've seen from 10 years of monetary experiments that the direct relationship between inflation and the state of the economy + monetary policy is tenuous at best. And this has benefitted the economy at large as we have pumped more and more money and cheap debt into the system with no apparent ill effects (except the ones that we choose to ignore, but I'm not here to beat that debt horse!). So it's already ridiculous to believe that the converse won't also be true. A 25 basis-point increase will do nothing to temper inflation.

Second, we have a new phenomenon that *does* seem to have a strong connection to inflation, both in theory and in practice. Inflation expectations among spenders and workers are higher than they've been in over a decade, wage increases at the bottom are faster than they've been in over a decade, and supply chains are more constricted than they've been in a decade.

Thus, if inflation persists, even at the not-hyper-inflation levels we're currently seeing, it's not a stretch to see that the Fed will have to make moves that shatter the confidence driving the second point. Once you accept the first point, that the Fed's tools have a weak causal relationship with inflation, it's clear that the only way they can stop inflation is to raise interest rates enough to tank assets, which will shake consumer confidence and bring demand in equilibrium with supply. If that isn't enough, they will be forced to go further and cause a recession, although this will take a lot of pushing, given their need to balance against the full employment mandate. Either way, I think we can all agree a quarter rate increase will do nothing.

I'm curious what other people's thoughts are. I'm not making any earth-shattering new statements, just connecting dots. To me, this outcome flows logically from the two points above, *if* you believe that higher inflation (but not hyper-inflation) will be persistent into next year."|0.89|957.0|0.0|957.0|[]

t3_qpckec|1636374477.0|investing|Understanding far OTM options|"Hi,

so I'm not sure I understand the very basics of options, or at the very least, I'm confused by the existence of far OTM options.

Let's just use an example with simple numbers (The numbers are OBVIOUSLY not correct, they're just in the ballpark). The stock of ABC Corp is trading at $100 a share, with ""decent"" volatility. 

An ATM Call with Strike Price ~100$ is trading at 10$, to breakeven I'd need the underlying to trade at 110$.

A deep ITM Call with Strike Price ~50$ is trading at 55$, to breakeven I'd need the underlying to trade at 115$.

A deep OTM Call with Strike Price ~200$ is trading at $1, to breakeven I'd need the underlying to trade at 201$.

Between the ATM and ITM, the difference looks to be clear: I need less of an upswing to make a profit with the ATM, but have a higher chance of losing what I paid for the option.

However, I don't understand the OTM call at all. Let's say I bet on the underlying suddenly increasing a ton, which is why I want to buy the OTM. Now, most likely, this is not going to happen, and I lose the $100(100*1$) I paid. But my confusion arises from the scenario where the price does break above the $200. Let's assume the price of the underlying is suddenly 205$:

My deep OTM would only yield (205-201)\*100=400$, even though I took this enormous risk! And even weirder, my ATM call would yield (205-110)\*100=9500$!

*So not only would I take way less risk by buying an ATM/ITM, I would ALSO profit MORE?* Clearly, this can't be right. What am I getting wrong here? Isn't it usually that the upsides of investments with greater risk tend to be greater, even if they happen with less probability? Yes, I paid less premium, but what interests me isn't the exact premium I paid, but rather the difference between currentQuote and (strikePrice+cost), since that's my profit."|0.86|25.0|0.0|25.0|['ABC Corp']

Among other things, I saw this in regards to shareholder rights:



-The company CEO would control 51% of the voting power.

-Shareholders are not allowed to take action through written consent. They are only allowed to do so during special meetings or annual meetings. 

-Afforementioned special meetings may not be called by stockholders (even majority). Only by majority of BOD, CEO, etc.

Do most companies have these rules in place to prevent take overs and unwanted changes in the body of the company? Is this common?

I am in my early twenties and I started a Roth ira through Charles Schwab earlier this year. I put the money I had in their S&amp;P 500 Mutual Fund ($SWPPX). Two years ago, I started putting $100 a month in a Robinhood index fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500 ($SPY) ""SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF"". 

I have been so busy with life I now realized I can just move all the money from Robinhood to the Roth so I get the passive income returns and can withdraw the money tax-free at 59.5 instead of paying taxes when I take the money out of the Robinhood ETF. Should I move the money to the Roth IRA? I have about 3.5-4x the amount in Robinhood. should I diversify the mutual funds a little?

For background, I’ve been investing in more safe, stable growth ETFs and stocks over the last few years and have stayed away from crypto because of their volatility, impracticality as an actual currency (due to wild swings im value), and rapid growth.

I get the appeal of it as a decentralized currency. I just don’t understand if the spikes in growth over the last few years are due to inflation fears, the formation of crypto-wallets/more exposure to the public, or just the fact that the new generation views it as something new/revolutionary. 

More importantly, I don’t know if this growth is sustainable, or if it will peak and die off as interest wanes. I would only consider investing a small portion (1-5%) of my portfolio in it, but just want to reevaluate my opinions towards crypto in general.

1. Time in the market is better than timing the market
2. The information gap between retail traders and institutional investors is smaller than ever. 
3. You aren’t an owner, you’re a speculator. And there's nothing wrong with that. Throw out the idea of stockholders owning a piece of the company. If you actually wanted to own the company, you’d want the price to go down, so you could buy more(Thanks mark cuban). But you don’t want your stock price to go down, do you? What’s that? You’re a long term trader who’s in it to collect dividends, and plans on duly exercising his voting rights, and you don’t mind if your stocks price goes down? Go fuck yourself with your baby shrimp dick sized dividend; I’m here to capitalize on growth, innovation and disruption.
4. A stock’s price is determined by the supply and demand to own that stock, and not based on realistic earnings and growth expectations. 
5. Supply and demand is determined by NARRATIVE. 
6. A stock's narrative is the collective story being told about both the individual stock and the larger financial market. What the market participants perceive and what they believe; including retail traders, institutions and regulators. 
7. The better you know your numbers, the better you understand technical analysis, fundamental analysis and business valuation- the better you’ll understand the all important narrative.
8. Learn to trade options or leave money on the table. You will literally lose your mind when you see the numbers on certain options trades and strategies."|0.35|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]

Second, bubbles are inherently difficult to time and identify because they can persist longer than we may think is rational. I have only been loosely following Rich and his team for a few years because they seem to offer good contrarian points of view and those are valuable to get. Anyone that has long term experience following Rich may be able to provide feedback on his track record. 

RBA’s team has identified 5 characteristics found in every financial market bubble and they lay out how each one is present in today’s market in the US. I’ll lay out their 5 points and the underlying rationale for each with supporting charts from RBA. 

1. Increased Liquidity 

The Federal Reserve has provided enormous levels of liquidity in response to COVID as evidenced by the simple growth in money supply. However this liquidity has been trapped in the financial markets due to bank’s lending and capital restraints implemented post-GFC. Since bank lending is supposed to be the mechanism through which monetary stimulus gets into the economy, their lack of high margin lending from low interest rates has inhibited money from leaving the financial markets. 

[M2 Money Supply](https://imgur.com/a/eNzFzhp)

2. Increased Use of Leverage

The increased use of leverage is indicated by the number of investors who have borrowed money to invest in the stock market. RBA references a survey from MagnifyMoney that showed 40% of individual investors have borrowed money to invest in the stock market. Almost half of those that borrowed has borrowed at least $5,000.

[Individual Investors Debt survey](https://imgur.com/a/M0uuYHR)

Investors have also added leverage through the increased use of options. Option volume still remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. 

[Retail Option volume](https://imgur.com/a/ArLgTut)

3. Democratization of Markets

Every bubble has a component of “everyone gets to play”. Chat boards, increased ease of trading, and meme stocks all make this quite evident. Below shows how trading has shifted to individual stocks, leverage is on the rise, and Google searches are driving option volumes. 



[Democratization of Markets](https://imgur.com/a/BGGEoeI)

4. Increased New Issues 

Investors’ desire to hold stocks or the bubble asset grows and the amount of new issues in a market grows significantly during bubbles. Cheap financing and issuance costs are driving the flood of SPACs and IPOs. Many of these new issues are tremendously speculative and serve the issuer more than the investor. The number of SPAC IPOs and the size of them have both popped. 

[SPAC volume and size](https://imgur.com/a/etMKycD)

5. Increased Turnover 

Trading volumes tend to rapidly increase during bubbles like day trading popped during the Tech bubble and flipping houses became the rage during the housing bubble. 

[Total Trading Volume is elevated](https://imgur.com/a/pylJXwh)


RBA goes on to emphasize this does not mean the entire market is at risk. They point out only 3 sectors have outperformed the market over the last 3 years (Tech, Comm Svc, and Cons Disc). The rest of the sectors and small-caps have been left behind. 

[Sector Performance](https://imgur.com/a/I8TvxAl)

Lastly, the bubble assets usually take a long time to recover. It took the NASDAQ 14 years to recover from the Tech bubble. 

[NASDAQ post Tech bubble](https://imgur.com/a/oWtA3B7)

However, they also demonstrate timing the bubble is not necessary. You could have been 3 years early selling bubble assets and buying the undervalued segments of the markets and still came out ahead during the Tech bubble.

there are valid criticisms to these points but we as humans can often justify why this time is different when it may not be. So are we in a bubble or are markets really changed forever?

Apart from having money already put into some stocks and crypto, I still have a large amount sleeping on a savings account that I would like to invest into a mix of these ETF’s.  A healthy amount of emergency savings, as well as room to invest in other stocks or crypto, are good to go as well.

Since it’s my first time investing in ETF’s, what do you guys think of the following ratios:

55% VOO + 30% VXF + 15% VXUS ?

Also.. when would be a good time to jump into these, as I’ve noticed there are dips every once in a while (like beginning of last month, for example).  These dips in ETF indexes seem to follow more of pattern/trend as opposed to individual stocks and cryptos.

The final vote was 228-206. Thirteen Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats in support of the bill, though six Democrats voted against it.
The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law, following hours of delayes and internal debating among Democrats on Friday, including calls from Biden to persuade skeptical progressive members of the Democratic caucus.
The legislation passed the Senate in August, but was stalled in the House as Democrats tried to negotiate a deal on a separate $1.9 trillion economic package, another key component of Biden's agenda that many Democrats had tied to the fate of the infrastructure bill.
The legislation will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, including money for roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package includes a $65 billion investment in improving the nation's broadband infrastructure, and invests tens of billions of dollars in improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion would go to building a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers, according to the bill text.
Biden called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just before midnight to congratulate her on the passage of the infrastructure bill, a source familiar with the call tells CNN. On the call, Pelosi thanked Biden for his help in getting the bill over the finish line as well.

The electric-vehicle maker backed by Amazon.com Inc. is offering 135 million shares at an expected price between $72 and $74 each. Previously, it expected a range between $57 and $62.

  At its previous range, the company would have been valued at just above $60 billion on a fully diluted basis.

General Motors Co. was valued at $85 billion.

 Rivian has said it would launch three models. The first, an electric pickup called the R1T, began deliveries to customers in September. A midsize SUV called the R1S is set to follow in December, along with an electric-delivery truck designed and built for Amazon. The online retailer has an order for 100,000 of the trucks, which Rivian said in filings it plans to deliver by 2025.  All three vehicles are set to be produced at a factory in Normal, Ill., that Rivian purchased from Mitsubishi Corp. in 2017

. The company has plans to expand that facility and has also said it is scouting locations for a new factory elsewhere.

I recently came across Nutanix which is a company I've heard of but didn't realize was public. Nutanix is the industry leader in hyperconvered infrastructure (HCI) which essentially makes them a competitor to vmware, dell, cisco, etc. in the on-prem virtualization space. I was doing some reading and it seems like their products are highly regarded in the industry. I also noticed they are growing hybrid cloud subscription services (SaaS) that can help customers abstract their cloud computing workloads away (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem can all be run from a single pane). I don't know exactly where they stand in this industry but evidently we are at peak cloud and large companies are starting to move workloads back out of the cloud to save money. Not to say cloud won't continue huge growth, but there is a trend of massive companies moving out of AWS,GCP,Azure due to cost, and fear of vendor lock-in. This creates opportunity for the hybrid cloud market which should see accelerated growth.

This company used to sell hardware but has recently undergone a transition into a subscription services company. This transition was painful and led to nearly no stock growth over 4 years. However with new leadership it looks like the company is pulling off the transition and starting to grow again.

Looks like a lot of execs have left the company but some well respected fresh leadership has come in (RR is CEO who used to be COO at vmware).

They currently operate at a loss but according to the new leadership will be cash-flow positive sometime in 2022. currently the company has

1.64 Billion annual revenue

As of this quarter 19% YoY revenue growth

83% annual recurring revenue

7.7 billion market cap

Heavily funded by bain capital

cost of revenue 78 million

a price/sales ratio of 5.5 (12 is average for software industry)

a Price to sales ratio of 5.5 for a subscription software company with 19% YoY revenue growth seems undervalued to me.

t3_qn9g3o|1636113174.0|investing|Stock Conversion Question - Preferred Shares to Common Stock - Should you Convert?|"&gt;According to Investopedia:  
The main difference between preferred and common stock is that **preferred stock gives no voting rights to shareholders** while common stock does. Preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.

When you invest in a crowdfunding/Pre-IPO there are different type of shares offered. Can you keep your preferred shares or should you convert them to common stock once the investment open market?

Or are you even able to keep them in preferred shares?

I found this note regarding this.  Is this true:

&gt;sometimes the privates shares may not become free trading. Typically, when a registration statement is filed with the SEC, the shares covered by the reg statement are listed. If your shares are part of that filing, then, once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, the shares would be deemed to be free trading. Mechanically, once a registration statement is effective, a company needs to have a Form 15c2–11 filed by a FINRA broker-dealer that completes the listing process on a national securities exchange - giving the shareholder of the now free trading shares a platform to actually sell such shares. That said, if your shares are not included in a registration statement, the IPO will not directly change the nature of the shares. However, the shareholder could later utilize the Rule 144 exemption after a 6 month holding period (all things considered), which would remove the restriction from resale on the shares  


And also:

&gt;An IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the first sale of stock by a company to the public. A company can either raise money by issuing debt, or equity (shares), to public or private buyers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Only private companies can carry out an IPO when they want ‘to go public’.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although an IPO raises a large amount of capital: becoming publicly traded results in stricter regulations and rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of conversion, shares are not converted unless the shareholder has elected to convert some of his shares to a public offering.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The differences between public and private shares are:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Publicly traded shares are sold on an established stock exchange. Ultimately providing liquidity to the company or the shareholder who has decided to offer his shares to the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;In comparison, privately held shares are not traded on the public market but through private transactions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The process itself:**

&gt;The steps undertaken in preparation for an IPO will vary, depending on the existing internal group structure spelled out in the Articles of Association. When going through an IPO’s engagement period, your registrar will carefully review your company’s Articles of Association and identify whether there are any share transfer restrictions. Following this the registrar will work, with other advisors to establish the actual mechanics behind effectively transferring the shareholdings to public / private buying institutions. The registrar ensures all required documentation and share delivery processes are in place.  
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of share conversion, the Listing Rules detail the administrative process for shareholders to transfer their equity shares from a Standard listing of shares to a Premium listing or any other type of share. The migration mechanism only applies to private companies with a listing of equity shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;If a certain class of share is publicly listed, then all shares in that class must be listed.

Found these articles on investing in ATH enviornment:

[Should You Buy An All-Time High?](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-you-buy-an-all-time-high/)

[Is Buying Stocks at an All-Time High a Good Idea?](https://mebfaber.com/2019/11/04/is-buying-stocks-at-an-all-time-high-a-good-idea/)

Essentially, it's showing based on past data that investing in ATH is not worriesome. Some notable callouts:

A. When  SP500 is near an all-time high, returns over the next year are similar to those when the SP500 is more than 5% away from an all-time high, which suggest fear of market crash could be more psychological. 


B. Average annualize return over the next three years when investing near an all-time high is 8.2% versus 7.4% when investing 5% away from an all-time high.


C. A strategy that just buy and hold stocks during ATH and switch to bond when it's not ATH, provide better performance and lower volatility than one that just buys stocks regularly. 


D. Similar observations made for international stocks.


IMO, the *most important* take away is to ensure that we have a (a) diversified portfolio, meaning not just investing in a single asset class, or worse a single company, and (b) not investing the entire nest egg at one single time but rather invest across time i.e. dollar cost averaging. 

With multiple news articles/blogs/tweets about a possible market correction, bear market etc., It's easy to over worry about investing in the current environment. Hope this helps others who like me am wondering if we should continue investing."|0.8|41.0|0.0|41.0|[]

t3_qm7rx5|1635983618.0|investing|Should you invest in IPOs?|"Hey guys, if you have ever considered investing in IPOs, or companies that have gone IPO in the recent years, then this post is for you. I did a bit of a quick research into this recently. But first, a quick recap of what Warren Buffet says about investing in IPOs:

* Warren Buffet has always been very vocal about his views on IPOs. His thought process is that ""*there are always better businesses to buy than IPOs*"". He always compares IPOs with other alternatives in the market, and so far, he has not found a strong justification for investing in an IPO versus another solid business at a good price.
* Buffet also dislikes the fact in IPOs, there are commissions that go to the stock salesmen, remember that IPOs are executed by investment banks so there is a push to sell IPOs like any other product, He likes to buy stocks where ""*no one is making any money on the sale*"".

I'd like to share with you some stats that I put together. Bear in mind the following:

* I took the [full list](https://www.iposcoop.com/scoop-track-record-from-2000-to-present/) of IPOs in the last 20 years from iposcoop.com.
* Filtered only companies that went public between years 2000 and 2015, so that at a minimum we have at least 5-6 years of post IPO performance.
* Calculated annualized performance using stock price from the first day close of IPO and current stock's price at the time this video was made.
* Performance from companies that are not currently trading were excluded.
* List [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/102ArUr35s1MLfyMm6rwnqhCvSo-L5f4JrmHAUlyk1pg/edit#gid=1482717621) for your reference.

**Results**:

* Total number of companies: 1396
* 45% of the companies (qty 616) have had negative annualized performance.
* 14% of the companies (qty 189) had sub 5% performance.
* **Almost 60% of IPOs between 2000 and 2015 underperformed the market.**

I also came across an [academic study](https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf) on Initial Public Offerings by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the Warrington College of Business in the University of Florida. One piece of information that caught my attention in his paper is Figure number 2, labeled Percentage of IPOs with negative EPS. If you check the figure, you'll notice how in recent years **over 75% percent of the companies that have gone public have had negative earnings.**

When you buy shares of companies, you get a piece of the ownership and therefore a piece of the earnings . Well, with IPOs in the recent years, in 75% of the cases there is no earnings for your shares. You are literally investing with the expectation that the company will become profitable, which by the way is already factored into the price that you are paying. So if these new public companies fail to turn a profit, or perhaps if their path to profitability takes longer, the stock price will suffer. Your only chance is the company continuously beating expectations. Not to mention that you don't even have enough years of financial reports to build a solid foundation for analysis.

Hope this helps. I don't want to discourage anyone though, a lot of people have made good money on IPOs, but base on the data it's pretty obvious that the average investor should stay away from them."|0.9|126.0|0.0|126.0|['the Warrington College of Business', 'the University of Florida']

Online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc said on Wednesday it would allow companies issuing shares through its IPO Access platform to set aside some stock for members of the public with ties to the issuers.

Directed Share Programs (DSPs), which Robinhood refers to as its ""friends and family"" offering, allows employees, customers, vendors, or others who have a relationship with the issuing company an opportunity to buy shares at the IPO price.

As part of the DSP program, the company reserves a portion of IPO shares for a specific group of people and Robinhood helps distribute these shares to those select individuals.

In May, the popular online brokerage unveiled the IPO Access offering, which gives retail investors the opportunity to buy shares in IPOs.

Large institutional investors and funds have traditionally been the first in line for allocations on IPOs, as the investment banks that control share allocations typically prioritize deep-pocketed Wall Street clients.

That typically leaves most retail investors with no option but to buy into stock of a newly listed company only after its shares start trading - which often means paying a higher price.

Through its new platform, Robinhood works with Wall Street investment banks to get allocations for retail investors.

Robinhood has partnered with 12 companies that have made their IPOs available to its customers, as of October 31.

Its latest offering will make IPO shares accessible to an even bigger pool of retail investors.

October 21, 2021, 12:04 PM UTC

 1. WTI spread hits $10 a barrel for first time in eight years
 2. Crude stockpiles at U.S. storage hub are shrinking rapidly

Time will tell which one is out of sync.
Is it a forward oil curve that yields 11% on an annualized basis for investors, or is it a headline price of West Texas Intermediate crude near $83 a barrel?

Because if there’s one thing over which there’s growing consensus in the oil market, it’s that the forward curve is more reflective of $100-a-barrel oil than the current price.
The spread between the nearest two December contracts hit a premium of $10 a barrel this week. The only other time this century it has been so strong was in 2013. When more immediate prices are pricier than later ones, it is called backwardation and is normally viewed as a bullish indicator.
“Crude backwardation remains relentless,” said Keshav Lohiya, founder of Oilytics, noting that the last time spreads were this strong WTI was above $100. “Either structure is too pricey or flat price is undervalued, our guess is the latter.”

The strengthening curve comes at a time when increasing numbers of analysts, traders and investors are once again talking of the prospects of oil prices returning to $100 a barrel. That possibility is being supported by an energy crisis that’s boosting demand for petroleum to be used for power generation, and steadily decreasing stockpiles worldwide.

In the case of WTI, though, the strength has been compounded this week by a sharp drop in inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, where oil futures are priced.
The market could be just weeks away from Cushing effectively running out of crude, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts including Natasha Kaneva said in a report. If nothing changes at the storage hub, WTI front spreads may spike to record levels and into a “super-backwardation scenario,” they said.
Wagers on market structure show up in traders’ positioning figures too. In WTI, one group of speculative investors is holding the largest position in spreads since 2008, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.

They reported a multi billion loss but they added a caveat that makes it sound like that it might not be as bad as it is presented.

 

&gt;Reported loss for the quarter was $2.5 billion, compared with a $3.1 billion profit for the second quarter 2021. This was driven by significant adverse fair value accounting effects\* of $6.1 billion pre-tax, primarily due to the exceptional increase in forward gas prices towards the end of the quarter. Under IFRS, reported earnings include the **mark-to-market value of the hedges used to risk-manage LNG contracts, but not of the LNG contracts themselves. This mismatch at the end of the third quarter is expected to unwind if prices decline and as the cargoes are delivered**. The underlying result is adjusted to remove this mismatch.

&amp;#x200B;

Would someone explain how it might work. Are they hoping the spot price will be less than the contract price in the future, so they won;t need their hedge prices.

&gt;Zillow, the digital real estate company, said on Tuesday that it’s exiting Offers, its business that buys and flips homes, and eliminating 25% of its workforce.

&gt;The announcement was attached to Zillow’s third-quarter earnings report. The company’s revenue and earnings missed analysts’ estimates.

&gt;“We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated,” Zillow CEO Rich Barton said in the release. “Continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility.”

&gt;The stock dropped about 7.5% in extended trading following a 10% plunge during regular market hours. The shares are now down about 10% for the year as of Tuesday’s close.

&gt;Here are the key numbers from earnings:

&gt;Earnings per share: loss of 95 cents adjusted vs. profit of 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts
Revenue: $1.74 billion vs. $2.01 billion expected by Refinitiv
Revenue in Zillow’s Offers business, which competes with Opendoor, climbed to $1.17 billion in the quarter. That’s way up from $186 million a year earlier, which was in the middle of the pandemic and in a dry period for transactions. However, the homes segment, which is mostly Offers, lost $422 million in the quarter, producing an overall net loss at the company.

&gt;Shares of Opendoor rose 7% in extended trading. The stock plunged alongside Zillow earlier in the day, dropping 15% at the close.

&gt;Zillow launched Offers in December 2019, starting with Southern California markets. The iBuying, or instant buying, product allowed homeowners to sell their home to Zillow for cash, eliminating a lengthy bidding, sales and closing process. They also didn’t have to worry about costly repairs before putting their house on the market.

&gt;“After closing on a home, Zillow will take care of necessary repairs, working with local contractors to complete projects like a fresh coat of paint, servicing HVAC units and other work a typical homeowner would do to get their home ready for sale,” Zillow said in a press release at the time.

&gt;But the home-flipping market proved to be a drag for a company that had built its brand on listing homes across the country and helping buyers and sellers connect through a marketplace. Prior to shuttering the business, the company said on Monday that it would stop buying houses through the end of the year, citing tight labor and supply markets.

&gt;“We’re operating within a labor- and supply-constrained economy inside a competitive real estate market, especially in the construction, renovation and closing spaces,” said Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow’s operating chief, in a statement this week. “We have not been exempt from these market and capacity issues and we now have an operational backlog for renovations and closings.”

&gt;Barton told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” after the report that Zillow’s ultimate failure was its inability to predict housing prices accurately. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the market dried up. It then bounced back dramatically, and prices in many markets have climbed to record levels.

&gt;For the home-flipping business to be profitable, a company has to be able to sell a home for more than the purchase price and have enough margin remaining to cover all the other costs, such as maintenance and sales and marketing expenses. Barton said the company realized that it’s not in a position to accurately predict where home prices will be in six months “within a narrow margin of error.”

&gt;Additionally, Barton said the Offers product reaches only a small sliver of the company’s overall audience, which is effectively the entire market of homebuyers and sellers across the country.

&gt;Zillow’s internet, media and technology business grew revenue 16% in the quarter to $480 million, with gross profit of just over $130 million.

&gt;“We just determined that being an iBuyer was too risky, too volatile and ultimately addressed too few customers,” Barton said. He added that, in closing the business, “the logic is clear, the emotion is difficult” because of the layoffs.

&gt;Bloomberg reported on Monday that Zillow was looking to sell 7,000 homes for $2.8 billion to institutional investors, as it looked to unload its portfolio of properties. Some of those sales would be for below the purchase price, Bloomberg said.

&gt;Barton didn’t confirm or deny the numbers in the Bloomberg report. He told CNBC that the company has always sold to those types of buyers since entering the market, and he acknowledged that Zillow does have properties that it needs to sell. The company bought 3,805 houses in the second quarter and sold 2,086 in that period.

&gt;“We’re not in any kind of fire sale,” he said. “We’ll wind down the inventory in an orderly way.”

Seems like the strategy of buying 80 cents for the dollar just to capture market shares has finally backfired."|0.98|2262.0|0.0|2262.0|['Zillow Offers', 'Offers', 'Bloomberg', 'Refinitiv', 'Zillow', '&', 'gt;Zillow', 'Barton', 'Opendoor']
t3_qlivf6|1635900740.0|investing|Can someone explain to me how margin actually is useful?|"I'm struggling to justify the use of margin, particularly in naked puts. I learn best by doing, but before doing I need to learn, so I'm in a bit of a catch-22 with margin.

The problem I'm having is visualizing the risk-reward to using it. I can take on substantially more risk with cash than I can take on with margin. And I can substantially concentrate my trades more with cash than with margin. (That is to say, the more concentrated in higher volatility, the more my margin buying power just begins to look like cash-only).

So inevitably it looks like I can outperform with cash more than I can with margin.

Thus the question, how is margin actually useful?

For simplicity, if I want to 2x my buying power, but I have to reduce my return by 1/2x, then I have effectively accomplished nothing. Correct? So for margin to be useful I have to be able to both maintain a certain rate of return AND increase the buying power. Yes?

I have some other advanced questions about house surplus, equity and journaling times, but I think first I just need to see someone justify the use of margin in the first place.

Another problem with a margin call that I have is that it removes my ability to choose when I lose. Now the brokerage gets to choose when I lose, and they don't care if 2 weeks later the trade reverses and I would be a complete winner.

That alone is a very big hindrance when working a long-game high risk trade.

Maybe someone can comment a little on that as well.

15% S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO vs IVV)

60% Total US Stock Market ETF (ITOT VS VTI)

25% Total International ETF (IXUS vs VXUS)





I've decided to leave out bonds for now in my taxable account. Bonds tend to be pretty tax inefficient and I don't love muni bonds(which are more efficient). At some point I'll likely add a little or skew my tax advantaged bonds a little higher. Realistically I'll do just a little of both in the future. 



For now though, I like to be more US based with some international around 75/25. While total US stock market includes the S&amp;P 500, I do like to add some tilt to S&amp;P 500 which is why I have 15% of S&amp;P 500 ETF.  I'm open to shifting these ratios a little, so let me know your reasoning if you think so.


This leads me to picking the best ETF for my situation, and I'm mainly down to vanguards version vs iShares version (open to other suggestions too). The commission on all of these are free. The expense ratio for all of them are .03%. All of them are very similar. 




**This leads me to really the most important and last point since they are so similar, which one is the most tax efficient? While it doesn't seem like a huge deal when looking at it initially due to the differences being small, if you are in a higher tax bracket and intend to put a decent amount of money per month in this fund and keep it for a long time, even the smallest difference is an important consideration. This is where it gets a little more uncertain for me. It appears that they have a similar dividend, but Vanguard's are more consistently qualified dividends (so I would be paying capital gains tax compared to regular income tax) compared to iShares which appears too have been giving more non-qualified dividends lately. This leads me to going towards vanguards over iShares. Is there any other tax considerations (or any considerations at all) I should be looking at in regards to these 6 ETF's?**"|0.83|33.0|0.0|33.0|['iShares', 'the S&amp;P 500', 'Vanguard']

*Do futures trading and commodity trading negatively impact the spot price of the underlying?*

Futures and commodity trading are one of the main way (if not the main way) how spot prices get determined.

But the sheer scale of futures and commodities market and their notional value is mind boggling and almost none of them lead to actual underlying being delivered. This makes me wonder, if there were no futures or commodity trades, wouldn't there be much more demand for the ""real thing"" and wouldn't it make the price much more volatile and much more higher than current price (as demand for the price appreciation or depreciation of that product is being fulfilled electronically rather than using the underlying asset). Speculators are fulfilling their need for speculation by trading the derivative instead of the underlying, what if there were no derivatives?

I hear about silver being a manipulated commodity where SLV etf in conjunction with futures is being used to keep spot price low; some people even imply that futures and commodity trading have helped keep speculators invest their money in those assets thus reducing the overall inflation in the broader economy as their money chase may be S&amp;P 500 futures instead of investing that money into the ""real"" economy.

“We’ve picked up a lot on domestic travel and should  pick up more than 250,000 barrels a day with easing restrictions on  vaccinated travelers,” Valle said. 

Air  travel remains a weak spot in the oil market’s recovery from an  unprecedented crash triggered by the pandemic last year, after flights  were grounded worldwide and commuters everywhere started working from  home. Air routes between the U.S. and Europe have historically been the  world’s most profitable for business travel. 

Under the new rules  taking effect Nov. 8, travelers from countries with low supplies of  vaccines who aren’t traveling on tourist visas, and those under 18, will  be exempt from the vaccine requirement.

George Dix, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects, sees  the boost from the new rules at 200,000 barrels a day of increased oil  consumption this quarter.

“We expect the main  boost to be from U.S.-Europe flights as U.S.-Latin America was already  operating close to pre-virus levels, and several other countries in  other regions are still some way off from opening up for international  flights,” Dix said.

For airlines, the recovery is coming with a higher cost for jet fuel, denting their earnings.

So far, I have mostly invested in ETFs, but I have dabbled in some stock picks. I wasn't aware that there was this concept of dual listing, so what I seem to have done so far is to randomly pick an exchange to buy whatever stock I want from. So for example I have a Belgian stock that I've bought on the Düsseldorf exchange even though it's also listed on the Viennese exchange. As far as I can recall there was some sort of weird tax when that company paid me dividends. I'm thinking now that if I had bought in Vienna then maybe that would have been avoided.

What I'm asking really is, what are the important differences between buying a stock on X and Y exchange? Is there potentially tax implications? If I buy all of my stock on the viennese exchange now because it's the cheapest with my broker and simplifies tax stuff, would I have a problem if I then moved to Germany, considering the fact that these stocks are also listed on German exchanges? Couldn't I just move the stock to a different exchange (this question doesn't even feel like it makes sense almost)?

In the last year, I've received a fair share of Instagram ads informing me about real estate investment offers, where the properties are managed (e.g. a hotel or furnished apartments) and as an investor I'm allowed to also use the property from time to time. Usually the return claimed is around 1.5-3%.

Usually, when I'm the person being approached about an investment opportunity I'm very sceptical: If it really were that good of an opportunity, why do you need to search for investors? At least for me, the up side would be that these can be funded with a mortgage with low interest of up to 1% (usually less).

Does anyone know how sensible such investments can be and if they are worth it?

I want to go into real estate and actually do not care a lot about it being less profitable, I'm already quite diversified. I see the big opportunity in cash flow and cheap leverage, but worry a lot about the management costs that might come with that.

I.e. Microsoft shareholders are getting a 3% yield ($66B/$2.2T) - with ~21% (and arguably 47%) growth. So if Microsoft just continues to grow as it's doing - and has been doing in recent years - we're talking a ~24% (3%+21%) net return. Sure, I'm simplifying, but fundamentally this makes sense.

This is INSANELY good especially when considering nearly half of Microsoft's revenue is recurring. I mean, if you were buying real estate with a 4% rental return, that'd end up around 2.5% net, you'd be very lucky to be getting 5% capital growth. That's a 7.5% (2.5% + 5%) net return at best. A 20% annualised return is what Warren Buffett, the world's best investor, used to consistently achieve in his heyday.

__Microsoft is no-brainer cheap, you should go ahead and buy. But it's not just Microsoft - all of GAFAM - Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft - which have a total market cap of $9T and up more than 10x over the last decade - do similarly well with the same basic analysis.__

How can this possibly be?

Ok, let's step back a bit, GAFAM, just 5 stocks, represent nearly 20% of the value of ALL listed companies in the US, up from 3% a decade ago. Think about that. Add other tech stocks to that and you have a monumental shift in the composition of US stocks. That needs a monumental shift in capital which needs investors to change their way of thinking. I mean, we're going through a real paradigm shift.

Now, sure, that shift is happening, we're all living it, but the world of finance, much of it controlled by older people fairly uncomfortable with technology, is going to lag - and this lag is the core reason why far from being some bubble, tech stocks in general are, despite their soaring valuations, still massively undervalued.”

Ok so here is the scenario. I have 175 shares of a stock. According to my TDA account my trade price for those shares is $14.35. The stock is currently trading at $7.35 so I am thinking I want to sell 75 shares and take the loss to offset some gains I made this year collecting premiums from selling CC's. 

I am trying to understand the wash sale rule though. Investopedia says ""a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss  and within 30 days of the sale (either before or after), you purchase  the same—or a ""substantially identical""—investment.""

The ""either before of after"" part has me a little confused though. If I refrain from re-buying shares of this ticker until December I should avoid a wash sale in the after section. When it comes to the before part, I bought 4 shares @ $10.38 on 10/4, 9 shares @ $9.18 on 10/12, and 1 share @ 10.10 on 10/20. Would those purchases in any way be considered a wash sale or would my selling 75 shares today be enough to record the loss against my gains for the year as long as I don't rebuy shares for 30 days?

I hope I've explained this adequately. Thank you in advance for your responses."|0.86|85.0|0.0|85.0|['non-IRA', 'TDA', 'Investopedia']

My post yesterday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qhoh2e/thematic_and_ideas_based_investing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) seemed to generate a fair bit of interest and thought I'd share some things that I thought could be of interest back to you all to say thank you!

For a bit of background, I am a research analyst at Morgan Stanley and previously have worked as a buy-side equity analyst at JPM Asset Management and Lazard Asset Management. Though I was covering a specific sector (retail/luxury/e-commerce), part of the job spec meant creating baskets based on ideas for professional clients. For example, I would create a basket of c20 stocks that we thought was the best way to play the 'reopening post pandemic' or 'the luxury boom in China'. 

Often the purpose of this was so that clients who are very generalist can get exposure to macro themes or ideas without having to do the individual stock work which is very time consuming. 

I always thought this kind of product may be of interest to retail investors. I.e. you can construct a portfolio with a handful of baskets based on the themes you want to play at the time. For example, as an investor, you might be a data analyst at Google and believe that data is going to transform the world and no one knows it yet... how do you play that trend in the markets? It's hard right!

I'm sharing some of the types of things we used to put together at Morgan Stanley here:

\- The next FAANGS ([here](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/msdotcom/what-we-do/wealth-management-images/uit/MSSNF2_Fact_Card.pdf))  
\- COVID-19 driven data adopters ([here](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/msdotcom/what-we-do/wealth-management-images/uit/Data-era-adopters.pdf))

Here's one from UBS that's more just a collection of top ideas ([here](https://secure.ubs.com/public/api/v2/investment-content/documents/pIQk7z9c5Akt5Q3jXCvhWA?apikey=Y8VdAx8vhk1P9YXDlEOo2Eoco1fqKwDk&amp;Accept-Language=de-CH))  


Just to also share, thought I'd attach JPM Ams latest guide to the markets ([here](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf))

If you guys are interested, I want to keep contributing thematic baskets and ideas, written up much better than those above\^ if there's enough interest? You guys have been here since I got my first job to where I am now so would love to share and help the community in any way!

t3_qi2pwd|1635474855.0|investing|How much a business generating over $100K per year should sell for?|"I would really appreciate any insights on how to properly evaluate  the cost of a small web-hosting business that has been generating over $100,000 each year since 2010. I switched to Stripe in 2014 where the  following table of gross volume is taken from, unfortunately data for  previous years are not available.

&gt;2014 - $128,100.00
&gt;
&gt;2015 - $231,000.00
&gt;
&gt;2016 - $163,000.00
&gt;
&gt;2017 - $130,300.00
&gt;
&gt;2018 - $143,200.00
&gt;
&gt;2019 - $120,000.00
&gt;
&gt;2020 - $96,034.36
&gt;
&gt;Since Jan 1, 2021 till Oct 28, 2021 - $103,700.00, expected more than $120,000
&gt;
That's gross volume generated, so how about expenses?

**Expenses**

After Stripe takes its share, the business pays the total of $653  monthly to US and EU based data-centers to host all customer projects,  about $45 do a CDN company, about $200 per month for the domain name  renewals. And literally **nothing else**: no license fees,  no any paid software (custom billing and customer support system build  on Drupal), no any money spent on advertisement (there is a potential to  grow, but didn't need any additional workload as the existing level of  more or less passively generated income was satisfactory), no any  contractors hired (a single experienced Drupal expert and system  administrator can carry all the occasional support requests as the whole  system is stable enough to run all by itself). Only need to pay his  share to uncle Sam.

Sounds ideal, so why sell?

**Reasons**

For last several years I have been involved in activities which exist  far from Drupal and technologies and which are gradually taking more  and more of my time. And while I will always be attached to everything  Drupal with strings of love, the other activities I'm involved are too  important to me (for that matter not only to myself, but lot's of other  people, so I have to set my priorities right).

To say frankly, I'm not desperate to sell, but find a reliable  partner who could equate what I'm putting on the table either by  bringing in their own business with similar income or to buy out the  half of already established and successfully running business. However,  in this case such a hypothetical partner will need to take over all the  current and future operations as my participation will be minimal.

**How much?**

I understand that in order to sell the company or partnership share  in the company, we need to know what is the total value of the company,  but I never did real evaluation. I know there are several methods to  calculate the price for a business, but not sure which one of them fits  best to this case:

\- **Return on Investment method**: It took many years  and lot's of efforts for my business to become an almost passive-income  generating source, but it's difficult to measure the cost of time and  labor spent.

\- **Sales of Comparable Businesses Method:** There are  not many comparable businesses as it is not Drupal shop per se, but  rather a hosing company with small loyal customer base. As I mentioned  above unlike Acquia or Pantheon my business is not advertising at all to  grow, it's not seeking to aggressively expand (maybe it should, because  potential is huge, however that was never a goal). And it's a small  niche, so not everyday companies like mine are sold.

\- **The industry formula approach**: The the rule of  thumb of this method assumes any profitable business with a stable  income worth several times its annual profits depending on the industry  and the workload. Which means that if we take average of last 8 years  given on the table above (2021 is not over yet, so November and December  should bring around $20K, so this year's gross should be around  $120,000, but let's take the current revenue of $103,700) - **$139,416.8** \- and multiple to 2 years to get **$278,833.6** Nobody sane would sell a stable business like mine for this price. Would I sell my business for what it generates in 3 years **- $418,250.4**?  I would say no, because no another almost passive business would bring  me the same kind of revenue in the next 3 years, so better to keep the  business and start hiring and paying salaries. Would I consider selling  for 4 year generated revenue equivalent of **$557,667.2**?  Maybe, if the new owner accepts transfer of the current subscriptions  (yep, all customers are on recurring paid subscriptions) and customer  base without acquiring the name, trademark and equipment.

\- **Asset Value Approach**: Among assets besides  mentioned earlier custom-built billing and ticketing system, the  business has a recognizable name, domain name, registered trademark and  owns around $150,000.00 worth of server hardware. And while the cost of  hardware is easy to calculate, it's not obvious how to evaluate the  developed software, know-how, domain name, trademark. If this was done,  then the final price of the business would be more or less clear.

To conclude, there are lot's of different ways of evaluating a  business, however taking into account my business operates in unique  type of small niche, I'm not sure what is the fair price to sell it  completely or to invite someone to buy out their share as a partner.

Sweden’s biggest pension funds from AP, and Sweden’s most famous technology funds from Swedbank will also officially be a part of the IPO. And these are only requests because shares are not guaranteed. There will be a free float of 17,9%, and there’s a high probability that everybody won’t get the shares they’ve requested, which could cause for huge demand on opening day. Considering the huge demand that exists right now and the fact that not everybody will be granted shares, there’s a good chance that this could lead to GGPI rallying today.

GGPI is a Spac that has an official agreement to merge with Polestar in the near future. Polestar is an electric vehicle company with a revenue of over a billion and has already delivered 20,000 cars as of October this year. Polestar’s cars have been received very well by independent reviewers and are usually ranked high on the lists of the greatest electric vehicles ever produced in the world today. Volvo Cars owns 49% of Polestar. If Volvo Cars opens strongly today and their IPO does good, there’s a huge chance that people who have missed out on buying Volvo’s stock, or people who want to be a part of Volvo’s future will run towards Polestar and buy GGPI which will cause it to rally.

TL;DR If Volvo Cars does well today on IPO day, there’s a huge chance that Volvo owned Polestar will rally today too, which is the spac ’GGPI’ that has an official agreement to merge with Polestar."|0.91|63.0|0.0|63.0|['Polestar', 'Volvo Cars', 'GGPI', 'Volvo', 'Swedbank', 'AP']

t3_qhpj5d|1635434841.0|investing|"""Dividends are just a forced sale"" is wrong."|" 

This came up in the M1 Finance Sub, but I will share here.

People who say that Dividends are just a forced sale are flat out wrong. They will point to the fact that the stock price often drops on the dividend ex-date, but ignore the fact that it almost never drops by the exact amount of the dividend, and sometimes even goes up. If it's a ""forced sale"" that shouldn't happen.

But they are stubborn and refuse to consider that. So here's some more obvious evidence.

**Scenario 1:**

* I borrow $5,000 from my M1 account at 2% interest, and I buy a stock that pays a 3%+ dividend over time.
* I use the dividend to pay off the loan.
* After some time, the loan is completely paid off, and I now own those shares free and clear. They paid for themselves.

In this way, Dividend stocks have a few similarities to real estate in that you can buy the asset with borrowed money, and use it to pay for itself.

If Dividends were just a ""forced sale"" then as I pay off the loan, the value of my portfolio should decline to zero. Because otherwise ""its just inventing money out of nowhere.""

""But, that's just market returns! I can do that with growth stocks that don't pay dividends, just by selling some!"" No, you can't. At least, not always. Dividend stocks you can, growth stocks you can't.

**Scenario 2:**

* I borrow $5,000 from my M1 account at 2% interest. I buy growth stocks that don't pay a dividend.
* Market declines 10%
* I now have liabilities of $5,000 + interest, and assets worth $4,500.
* I can't even repay my loan by selling. Let alone make money. I have to pray the market turns around and my hot new tech stock works out and doesn't fall on its face.

**Scenario 3:**

* I borrow $5,000 from my M1 account at 2% interest. I buy dividend stocks that pay a 3%+ dividend
* Market declines 10%
* I use the dividend to pay off the loan
* I still have my portfolio of $4,500 worth of stock that I bought with somebody else's money.

I'm not saying growth stocks are bad. Growth stocks are good. I own a lot of them.

But the idea that ""dividends are just a forced sale"" is wrong.

When you buy a business, you are buying a value producing asset. Dividends are capitalizing on that value.

To return to the Real Estate comparison. Not exact, obviously, but illustrative to clarify

* Dividend stocks are rental properties (that you don't have to maintain). You buy the asset, and it produces income for you for as long as you own it. It will likely pay for itself over time.
* People who buy Growth stocks are ""House flippers"". They don't take any of the income the property could produce by renting it. Instead they fix it up, and hope to sell it to somebody at a higher price. If you pick the right house in the right neighborhood, this works if the market is going up. You can get burned if the market is going down.

Both are valid ways of making money. Both produce value.

But to say ""Dividends are just a forced sale"" indicates somebody who doesn't understand how dividends work."|0.39|0.0|0.0|0.0|['M1']
t3_qhoh2e|1635431841.0|investing|Thematic and Ideas based Investing|"Hey guys,


I’ve been looking into managing my money on a more thematic basis. By that I mean investing in ‘ideas’ as opposed to individual stocks. From my understanding it seems like there’s a lot of products out their for mutual funds/ETFs and a lot for individual stock pickers. Was wondering if there’s anything out there, platform wise, for thematic or ideas based investing in the middle ground? 

I’ve noticed a large number of brokers have started getting on this trend. E.G Morgan Stanley now have a dedicated thematic research desk and I know a lot of asset managers offer themstic funds but I’d like to build them out myself based on ideas but don’t want to go through the hassle of finding the individual stocks. 

One use case might be that I want exposure to China’s burgeoning middle class as a theme or perhaps stocks stood to benefit from the recent UK budget announcement etc.

&gt;The performance benchmarks show the Intel Core i5-12600K blasting up the single-core test with a score of 773 points and the multi-core test with 7220 points. This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.

&gt;Now think about it this way, you are essentially getting slightly better performance than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a $400 US+ chip, in a processor that costs $30 US lower than the Ryzen 5 5600X. It sounds like an absolutely phenomenal deal. Obviously, there are a few drawbacks which include investing in a brand new platform and migrating to a new OS platform (Windows 11 in this case) which would raise the cost and effort but if you set your mind aside from these short-term concerns, the Core i5-12600K could end up serving you far better performance at an insane value proposition. Furthermore, it is also stated that owing to the 12600K being segmented in the Core i5 lineup, its power consumption and thermals won't be as rampant as the high-end models."|0.61|61.0|0.0|61.0|['AMD', 'Intel']

I'm specifically staying away from more speculative ones - i.e., no retail space owners, no businesses that just hold mortgages, etc. Just companies that actually own property and collect rent. Simple, easy to follow.

The REITs I'm thinking about are:

* UMH - residential real estate
* DEA - own office space and lease it to the US government
* CCI - own cell towers and lease to Verizon, Dish, etc.
* SLG - Manhattan office space, took a BIG hit in March 2020, been climbing back up since

I have 2 schools of thought from 2 different people who both have made serious money over the past decade using stocks/options/etc. The 1 friend tells me to check at least once a day all accounts in case something big happened (i.e. a company exec is indicted and it sends the stocks tumbling 5%). The 1 other friend says to check at most 1 time every month, nothing more. His logic is that Robinhood and other brokerage accounts will usually on the front page after logging in tell you what you have in stocks, how much they are up for you since buying - and this can trigger something inside you to say ""made too much money to loose, sell now""... Only to see the stock keep going up for another few years. 

I would be somewhere in the middle. I would say also that both of my friends are biased towards there methodologies because both of them have market orders on legit every single one of their stocks. So if they go up 400% in 1 day or tank in 1 day, they are still holding until they take action. I would be more inclined to say check every Monday, so 1 time a week.

Kind of crazy to put it like that but it's the truth in many cases. For example a dentist makes a lot more money if they can do a crown and a root canal on you than a filling or a preventive service. This is why dentists don't march on Washington DC to have added sugar banned, that would be great for health, but horrible for the dental industry under the current business model. Or a doctor makes more money for giving you a pill for the symptoms of a problem, rather than helping you make lifestyle changes to actually solve or prevent the problem. This is why there is fast food in many hospitals. And many biotech companies often end up aiming to produce ongoing treatments for things, rather than cures which are a one time payment. 

Anyway there are some bright spots, it's not all like that, for example pediatric dentistry is a much more health focused model.  But I was wondering if anyone had ideas on how we could financially incentivize dentists for example by how many teeth they save or something like that? I don't really have an answer, just kind of being an idealist and curious if anyone has ideas? Also would be interested in any healthcare investments that have a business model that supports that idea, where they company is really mainly rewarded for prevention or cures etc?"|0.7|10.0|0.0|10.0|[]

&gt;Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

&gt;Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

&gt;Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

&gt;""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

&gt;Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

&gt;Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

&gt;""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

&gt;Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

&gt;Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

&gt;Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more

&gt;However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

&gt;""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

&gt;Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

&gt;Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

&gt;""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.

&gt;Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.

&gt;Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.

&gt;The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.

&gt;""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.

&gt;""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

&gt;Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

&gt;Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

&gt;With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

&gt;Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.

&gt;Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

**Edit**: Imagine you time travel back to October 25th, 2019. Two years ago, TSLA stock was trading at **$59.64**, pre-split, and have the following conversation with someone:

You: I came from the future, in 2 years TSLA will be trading at $1,000 and is part of the S&amp;P500.

You: Actually no, it went through a 5:1 split, so almost a 100x increase. And also let me tell you about this thing called Shibainu coin and a global pandemic...

I'm generally cautious of throwing more money at real estate since our house is already such a volatile, leveraged part of our financial portfolio (very young with a \~12% down payment). But REITs such as IVR are still drastically lower than pre-covid levels. Here's my bull thesis:

1. \~ 10% dividends. This is my primary reason for investing.
2. Even at current rates, the stock price seems depressed
3. If (when, IMO, but if), rates increase these stocks should be some of the main benefactors.

So in my eyes, I'm seeing a low risk 5%+ APY (giving space for the stock to continue dragging down, or for divs to be cut down) that's also a good hedge to rate raising (not penciled in, but possible with all the hyperinflation \*hype\* going on).

If this happens I want to have some exposure to asset classes that would benefit from an increase in rates. What would be the best options for this? Bonds are the first thing that comes to mind, but I can see some drawbacks, specially if we're talking about an inflationary scenario:

- Even with a rise in rates, nominal yields will likely stay below inflation on treasury bonds, yielding negative real returns. I don't see the FED rising rates to 3%+ anytime in the near future.
- I would have to hold the bond until maturity, selling it would be bad if rates keep rising because price is inversely correlated to yield.

TIPS does not sound like an alternative, its yield being bond yield minus inflation, so if bonds are below inflation so will TIPS (which is the current scenario, TIPS having negative yield). Gold price is inversely correlated to yields so it's a no-go. Crypto is high risk and I expect it would behave like so, with prices also falling, though it's hard to say. Are 1-2y bonds or CDs the best option here if I don't want to hold bonds for 10y?

Is there any asset class from which one could expect positive real returns in a scenario of rising rates?"|0.67|14.0|0.0|14.0|[]

I have been debating with myself for the last week if all the recent news around Facebook building a Meta-verse already priced in, or it is too early for investors to realize the big picture and potential upside of that?

Following a few recent articles [article#1](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-plans-hire-10000-eu-build-metaverse-2021-10-17/) and [article#2](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/09/facebook-zuckerberg-metaverse-stephenson-big-tech) and also all the progress they have been making about making Oculus more affordable, it seems that they are planning to spend a lot of $$$ on this in the next few years. 

On the other hand we also have Unity working in the same direction [article#3](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/27/how-unity-is-positioning-itself-to-democratize-the-metaverse/) and [article#4](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459091-unity-software-the-metaverse-can-be-a-game-changer). I wouldn't be surprised if they team up with Facebook to accelerate the growth and absolutely dominate the market. They would have both the capital and the technology to be the first and the best.

I am trying to stay away from the negative sentiment towards FB right now around all the politics around all the social platforms, I am aware that can have a very negative impact towards the short terms stock price, but looking at the big picture it is probably not going to hurt them too much.

In the same time we have all the climate changes, possible economic crises coming in the next years, that could make life much tougher for the lower and middle class, which would make escaping into a meta-verse, a very tempting solution for millions of people... Quite much looking like the plots of Ready Player One and Snow Crash.

Here is my take on the three big sectors of the financial services industry.

Banks are rather interesting because their wall street and main street components have performed very differently In the pandemic. Wall Street banks saw a boom in deal-making and mergers and IPOs and with the increased volatility a surge in trading revenue. This has contributed to the insane runs of Goldman and Morgan Stanley and some of the commercial &amp; investment mixes like Citi, BofA, and JPM. However, with all-time low rates and low borrowing demand plus the fact that consumers continued to pay off their loans, many banks main street component suffered as a result when rates rise however this component should do well as the bank's margin increases. The truth is this deal-making boom can't go on forever and ec=ventually the money growth will slow, the Ibanks and the mixes are going to need to find another revenue source to justify their amazing runs, wealth management seems to be the big one Citi, MS and Goldman are betting on.

Private equity rather stunning run can largely be attributed to low rates which make borrowing for their traditional LBO super easy and profitable. This allows them to generate way more revenue more quickly and add way more assets to their balance sheet. This all plus the amazing rise most asset classes have contributed to an amazing run in private equity especially KKR and Blackstone. Overall though these will do poorly when rates eventually rise, I think these have a little more room to go however it's getting hard to justify these high prices with rising rates around the corner.

Insurance companies are definitely the area that I'm least knowledgeable in but ill give it a go. They derive most of their profits from investments both from Bons and blue-chip stocks, they do this with the money they generate in premiums, when rates rise buying bonds especially is more profitable with a greater yield. The other big factor here, in my opinion, is global warming, this will inevitably cause more disasters and thus more damage, this hurts insurance companies and is definitely a factor you should consider before investing in an insurance company.

Overall, in my opinion, the best sector in the financial services industry is banks because they are the most insulated and will actually benefit from a higher rate environment. private equity is amazing if rates remain low and I'm not very knowledgeable about the insurance industry so if someone more educated can correct me that would be great."|0.83|24.0|0.0|24.0|['Goldman', 'JPM', 'BofA', 'KKR', 'amp', 'Ibanks', 'MS', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Blackstone', 'Bons', 'Citi']

Here is an example of a situation a real life investor might experience:

If you take a 30 year old and he/ she starts to invest $1500/ month (18k/ year) for 30 years (until age 60) at a imaginary 8% return per year he/she will end up with 2+ MILLION.  

That is the type of example everyone has seen, but here is what most fail to appreciate which makes investing hard for many folks even with the best intentions...

1/2 of that return (1 MILLION) was gained only in the last 7-8 years of that 30 year period.  So even if the investor was diligent and did what he/ she was supposed to do they would have felt like they weren't making any progress, i.e. spinning the wheels for the first 22 years or so!  In fact, waiting for high growth at the end is NORMAL.  Folks get bummed out they aren't millionaires after about 1, 3, 5, even 10 years, but the above person ended up with 50% of all their future money to spend in the last 8 years or so (age 52-60 in this example).

Just an observation that may help others.  The point being once  you have an set asset allocation your job is just to be a robot and save EACH month over and over again and don't worry about the total $$$ in your accounts.  The latter you won't appreciate until the end of the journey (20+ years later from when you started).

I'm taking a minority view here on Facebook, and believe it'll breakout after earnings, in spite of;

1. regulatory pressures from Congress
2. SNAP's harbinger of advertising headwinds
3. Stock prices dropping after each of the last three ER's.

However, to hedge against IV crush if the price action goes bearish, I took a \*\*December Vertical Call Spread.\*\* 

(read further for rationale)===========

. The expected ER is $3.19, compared to last quarter's $3.61 actual.

. FB in their conference call had already mentioned Apple's algo

. While SNAP was greatly affected by AAPL and thus dropped a quarter of it's price, FB is far bigger and has multiple revenue streams. The impact will be minimal, and think that it will surpass estimates, top and bottom.

. POC on the daily chart (from last ER until today), is at $341, which was in the range of yesterday's trade.

. Post-ER, I'm expecting it to reach above POC (as to how far up will depend on guidance).

. Whichever way price goes post-ER, expect the price to settle around POC level. Hence, a vertical debit spread for Dec, 330/335C was a safe bet to end in profit, with a max of 110%.

t3_qdple3|1634934679.0|investing|I am planning to make a small investment into IPv4 addresses and hold for ~5-8 years. Looking for feedback.|"Hey there. Yeah, unusual, I know. Constructive criticism, please. Let's get to it.

The opportunity here is to capitalize on the limited amount of IPv4 addresses in open circulation. The risk is that IPv6 adoption will occur sufficiently prior to any price increase and will result in loss of demand in IPv4.  Put differently, this is a bet that companies which are unwilling, or unable, to fully adopt IPv6 will pay a significant premium to continue doing business using their current tech.

The price of IPv4 addresses has risen from \~$8/ea in 2014 to $50/ea in 2021 ([1.](https://i.imgur.com/EqW5jKn.png))

* One concern here is that price growth was flat in 2019 before it started growing sharply in 2020. This might be indicative of a short-term bubble due to unexpected increased demand in remote needs.
* This is a relatively high-volume market. There are tens of millions in transactions occurring weekly. ([2.](https://i.imgur.com/nbMvpKZ.png))
* You must hold purchases for two years before they are able to be resold. ([3.](https://ipv4marketgroup.com/arin34/))

IPv6 adoption has grown from 3% to 38% from 2014 to 2021. [(4.)](https://i.imgur.com/ItptmoP.png)

* This represents 5% growth per year. 10 years from now would be 88%.
* Adoption growth is linear and *slowing* \- adoption has not quickened in response to the IPv4 price hike. Growth was exponential in 2014 and slowed to linear.
* Adoption has been far slower than anticipated. ""On 7 March 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group for IPv4 sunset ... in May 2018 this working group was closed as no immediate work could be identified due to the slow transition to IPv6."" ([5.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_deployment#Coexistence_with_IPv4))

I think this is a good play for me personally because:

* I work in tech and feel I understand the needs of tech decently well.
* I am looking for a 'collectible' asset for part of my portfolio. I see IPv4 addresses as something similar to investing in M:TG cards, for example. I want to hold slightly less cash without investing more into stocks or cryptocurrency.
* I do not have any reservations about holding for half a decade. This is a small amount of money (\~5% of portfolio) and have absolutely no intent of selling within two years.

I was also able to find:

&gt;We find that positive excess (strong) analyst coverage is associated with overvaluation and low future returns. This finding is consistent with the view that excessive analyst coverage, driven by investment banking incentives and analyst self-interests, raises investor optimism causing share prices to trade above fundamental value. However, weak analyst coverage causes stocks to trade below fundamental values. This finding indicates that investors tend to believe that these firms are more likely to be plagued by information asymmetries and agency problems. The results remain robust after controlling for the possible endogenous nature of analyst coverage and analysts' self-selection bias.

They are going to piggyback on the traditionally low-margin but high-growth battery storage industry but use their AI to increase ROI on battery storage by distributing power more efficiently. Selling that software will boost their margins and allow them to monetize the green energy wave to a much higher extent than other green companies. Based on the macroeconomic conditions and financial data, STEM is extremely undervalued.



They have over 340% annualized revenue growth and have improved their margins + their Athena software is high-margin and uses artificial intelligence to scale microgrids &amp; efficiently distributes power in energy storage projects to improve ROI.

Using Stem's full-year revenue forecast (which was created BEFORE the huge grid instabilities lately, which only boosts their thesis) they have a forward price/sales of 19 for a company with over 340% revenue growth and a successful high-margin software product

So far Athena has been sticky and I see it allowing Stem to combine the [high margins of Athena](https://s27.q4cdn.com/138752898/files/doc_presentation/2021/09/Stem_InvestorPresentation_2021-September-vF.pdf) with the fast growth of green energy to become a massive money printer.

t3_qdgqzj|1634908649.0|investing|Will the recent copper shortage be an opportunity for smaller miners?|"As the world gradually shifts to renewable energy, advancement of technologies involve a lot of renewable energy projects, the demand for copper just keeps on increasing. A lot of companies struggle to provide and respond to this demand, but there are recent issues going on with bigger companies. 

Due to the restrictions caused by the pandemic, BHP’s Escondida mine has issues in operation, resulting in a drop in their copper production. Codelco’s copper production took a dip recently, going down by 6.7% with their produce after a strike in one of their mines. Now this is critical, since both companies are mining Chile, and the country is known to be top copper producer in the world.

But as the world grapples with the copper shortage and the price surges this year, I believe smaller companies that already started producing and some that are still drilling are showing great potential to help provide and match the demand.

One miner that could be an excellent player would be [Copper Mountain Mining](https://cumtn.com/) ([CMMC](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CMMC:TSE)). Their flagship asset is the 75% owned Copper Mountain mine located in southern British Columbia near the town of Princeton, and they are currently producing approximately 100 million pounds of copper equivalent, with average annual production expected to increase to approximately 140 million pounds of copper equivalent. They recently released drill results at their Cameron Copper Project in Australia, where three large mineralized zones are identified.

[Solaris Resources](https://www.solarisresources.com/) ([SLS](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SLS:TSE)), on the other hand, boasts the Warintza copper project in Ecuador, and this mine is along a mineral belt that hosts Lundin Gold’s Fruta del Norte Mine and a Chinese consortium’s Mirador mine, about 40 km to the south.  They have a massive cash cushion and their cash burn is way under, which can be considered as a good sign. They have about $60 million on the balance sheet right now and approximately $20 million needed for the remaining 2021 CAPEX. Their shares increased more than 8% recently after the price of copper increased throughout the week to $4.2435. 

I am looking forward to seeing the growth of [Fortitude Gold](https://www.fortitudegold.com/) ([FTCO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTCO/)). They’re a small producer, but it is worth considering that they have no debts. They also [reported positive metallurgical test results](https://www.fortitudegold.com/news/fortitude-gold-reports-positive-golden-mile-metallurgical-test-results) from its Golden Mile property with column leach tests reporting up to 85% gold recovery. They also recently increased its monthly dividend by 14% and intercepted numerous high grade gold intercepts in untested open areas.

With global climate goals demanding for more copper, copper mining companies will need to strive to produce. There have been issues going in Peru and Chile, since its governments is threatening to increase mining taxes and regulations. With the increasing demand and the increasing prices, a lot of industries that utilize will encounter a lot of issue unless the need for the precious metals gets matched by production."|0.93|403.0|0.0|403.0|['Codelco', 'Copper Mountain Mining](https://cumtn.com/', 'BHP', 'Solaris Resources](https://www.solarisresources.com/', 'Lundin Gold’s', 'Fortitude Gold](https://www.fortitudegold.com/']

Any opinions or thoughts on the companies below are appreciated. I have a number of other stocks i trade or hold but these are a handful of the companies I really believe in longterm with the exception of maybe snapchat. I just had to note that one due to the 22% sell-off we are seeing after hours...

Netflix - reported solid numbers overall with eps coming in at 3.19, an 83% increase over the same period last year...they brought in 7.48 Bil in revenue and 1.45 Bil in net profits. They added 4.38 million new paid subscribers and expect that number to double next quarter, bringing the total count to 213.6 million. I believe the price action to the upside is justified and will continue. 

Tesla - best quarter yet for the ev car maker ! 13.76 Bil in revenue and 1.6 Bil in net profits. Gross profit margin increased to 26.6%. They delivered 241,300 vehicles and total production came in at 237,823. Numbers looking good and the price action/sentiment is very strong. Arkk base case for tesla shares is steep but starting to sound like a very possible reality. if the stock breaks above the previous all-time-highs of 900.40 we should see a decent move to the upside. I'm thinking 1k could come quick. 

SNAP - down 22% after hours on a fairly decent Q3 report...fwd p/e is a little high so it doesn't surprise me. Investors want a big beat on these growth companies sometimes and push the price down hard if eps doesn't come in much higher than expectations, especially if the stock has been performing so well. 

Shopify - earnings coming up next week on October 8th along with Amazon...growth is not appearing to slow up in 2021. Looks to me like they started ballooning as a company at the perfect time. They were well positioned to take advantage of the lock downs and have managed to maintain strong sales moving forward as things begin to open back up to some degree. I do not believe a full reopening of the economy would hurt the company at all. In fact it would likely be a driving factor for more growth and would help them sure up their position in the e-commerce sector. Nothing to report here yet for Q3 but i will be waiting. 

Coinbase - expected to report November 5th, seems well positioned from a TA perspective to really take advantage of what is likely to be another rally in the crypto space...

t3_qd0vaj|1634848694.0|investing|Explaining the concept behind sports arbitrage and why it is an investment and not gambling|"I don’t know how aware/interested people are in sport arbitrage ‘betting’. It says ‘betting’, however I believe it is an investment as there is no real ‘bet’ involved. Arbitrage betting is when two different bookmakers disagree on the odds of a two-way market (only two possible outcomes), therefore meaning if you bet on both sides of the market you will certainly make a small profit. An example will make things much easier:

SWEDEN VS KOSOVO - 9TH OCTOBER

MARKET - BOTH TEAMS TO SCORE

BET 1: MANSION BET (YES) ODDS - 2.45 (STAKE £125) (Potential return £306)

BET 2: BETVICTOR (NO) ODDS - 1.75 (STAKE £175) (Potential return £306)

1 bet will win the other will lose, but either way we will get back £306, when we only staked £300, this is a 2% ROI .

A 2% profit doesn’t seem like much in betting terms and is smirked at in betting communities but when you look at it as an investment it’s very exciting, I usually place arbs between 2-5%.

So why am I not a millionaire as this is essentially free money. This is the bad news; bookies don’t like it (it’s not illegal though) because they will certainly lose money over time. It’s easy to spot a foolish arbitrage bettor as they will bet on games in the Syrian 4th division etc. Therefore, there are many rules you must abide to arbitrage bet successfully. The main aim is to look like you are a punter, find arbs that are in high volume markets (top European football leagues), bet round numbers (not £97.65 etc) and at normal betting times. Eventually they will catch on to you and limit/close your betting accounts, but you can easily make a couple of thousand before then. Another difficulty is finding the arbitrage opportunities in ‘normal’ markets, as you might expect the more popular betting markets are the more efficient market odds, however there are some great tools and websites that can help."|0.75|35.0|0.0|35.0|[]

t3_qcenkq|1634774634.0|investing|Lies My Accountant Told Me or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Roth|"This post is a summary of comments from threads and blog posts comparing traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs. In particular, I wanted to offer some arguments against 5 major points that find their way into many of the comparison threads.

**1st sentiment to dispute: low income earners who expect to make more later should do Roths, high income earners who expect to make less later should do traditional.**

I have seen this point a few times:

&gt;If you’re in a high bracket and expect little or no income in retirement take traditional. Otherwise if you’re in a low bracket now and expect more income in retirement take Roth. Or just do both.

This is how I used to think and, on the surface, it is an accurate statement. I myself am currently in a high earning tax bracket, and have favored traditional IRAs historically assuming that I'll be making less in retirement. And that is true--I will have more available cash at the current time and will be paying a lower effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal.

There's one major problem: while it is true that for high income earners using a Roth you are paying a higher current tax rate, *you are paying a 0% tax rate on your gains.* This 0% tax on capital gains **usually** outweighs the taxes saved at time of deposit with a traditional IRA. What's even worse for traditional IRAs is that when withdrawn this money is taxed as ordinary income instead of as capital gains.

\-

**2nd point to dispute: the investment accounts work out to be the same over time.**

This leads me to the next sleight-of-hand that some traditional IRA advocates try to pull. Take a look at [this Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169hUK91cs7W7aJaXyQLQO4ZvyCKCDL7owhKS-0nf1S0/template/preview) that calculates gains for traditional vs Roth.

Now it's tempting to look at these numbers and think ""Aw geez Rick, there you go. It doesn't matter, you end up with the same money either way."" But look at the assumptions this sheet is making: Instead of having you max out your Roth, it assumes that the 5k you were going to put into your traditional IRA is reduced to 3.5k with your Roth. But for the more investment aware individual, they will be maxing out their Roth. In this scenario, we're not depositing less, we're depositing the maximum and paying more in taxes (ie. losing available cash). Then, you get the same gains as a traditional but with a Roth they're already post-tax.

Using the scenario in the linked Excel chart we can reflect a scenario specific to high income earners that expect to make less at retirement: $1250 of extra available cash each year with a traditional because of the IRA deposit being tax withheld. 1250 x 12 = $15k of more available cash over 12 years that you would have had at the cost of of $20.2k of additional taxes at retirement (assuming a scenario with a marginal tax rate of 37% with a Roth and 22% with a traditional IRA). If you stayed in the same marginal tax bracket of 37%, you'd be looking at $35k of additional taxes for that $15k of available cash.

Here is another example taken from a comment comparing IRAs to Roths with the following math:

&gt;assuming 30% tax  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 = 7,000 after tax going into roth = $122,145.82 after 30years @ 10%  
&gt;  
&gt;10,000 full going into trad/401k = $174,494 after 30years @ 10% = $122,145.82 after paying 30% marginal tax rate.

But the numbers evolve differently if you are maxing your IRA out. The reason I think this is more accurate is because if you have any sort of savings (high yield savings accounts, bonds, CODs, money market funds) then the additional available cash that you get with a traditional IRA is simply redistributed savings -- ie. arbitrage.

* *Roth investment*: 15,900 = 10,000 after tax going into Roth at 37% marginal tax rate = $175k after 30 years at 10% - $5,900 of less available cash at the time of deposit (with a higher tax rate and principal) + $54k gained (""tax free"" or post-tax gains) at the time of withdrawal = **$49.7k overall gains.**
* *Traditional investment*: 10,000 pre-tax going into traditional IRA with $5.9k more available cash at time of deposit, in exchange for 18.7% effective tax rate at withdrawal instead of 37% marginal tax rate at time of deposit as would have occurred with a Roth = $175k after 30 years; 54k gained but taxed at 18.7% effective tax rate instead of 37% = **33k overall gains.** This assumes a withdrawal all at once instead of in smaller chunks.

So, taking into account the different expected tax rates, with a traditional IRA you are giving up 17k of long term gains for an additional 5.9k of available cash at the current time. What you do with this money determines its opportunity cost.

And even if you were to reinvest this 5.9k, you would have an account with capital gains lag depending on fund turnover, so it would not grow as fast as it would have post-tax in the Roth.

[This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y6mzycEYlLENzPre8VtQBfBFmSJT06IOAlju3HBmHWo/edit?usp=sharing) is a (corrected) version of a retirement spreadsheet originally posted by u/jeff_varszegi in [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/) that you can use to try out different scenarios to make sure this logic applies for your specific circumstance.

\-

**3rd point to dispute: the first/last dollar argument**

Here is a quote from a financial blog I came across:

&gt;Dollars saved in a Traditional 401k / IRA are pre-tax.  We pay no income tax on dollars going in, an immediate savings of up to 39.6%, the highest marginal rate.  The invested funds are allowed to grow **tax free**, so all interest, dividends, and capital gains are untaxed until withdrawn from the account.  Upon withdrawal, all funds are treated as ordinary income, similar to a paycheck.

The invested funds in an IRA don't grow ""tax free"". As said by the author themselves in the first sentence, they grow **pre-tax**. The invested funds in a Roth also don't grow ""tax free"" but **post-tax**. This is the major benefit of a Roth over traditional.

&gt;Think about it this way.  When we invest $1 in a 401k, that dollar is the last dollar we earned.  It is taxed at our highest marginal rate.  But when we withdraw $1 from our 401k years from now, it is our First Dollar.  As we saw in the pretty pictures earlier, the First Dollar is always taxed at 0%

I would disagree with this. Instead it should be a ""last and last dollar"" argument. What are you paying as far as a marginal tax rate on the Traditional vs the Roth -- ie. what would an individual have been making otherwise. Required minimum distribution, part time work, etc. You have to take into account other income streams to know your base income and effective/marginal tax rates.

\-

**4th point to dispute: It's pointless to try to predict the future.**

Another argument I've heard is that tax rates are difficult to predict in the future. Past performance is not a predictor of future results. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

While researching this idea I came across the following charts:

[Chart 1](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170804133536/Average-Effective-Tax-Rate-on-the-Top-1-Percent-of-U.S.-Households.png) [Chart 2](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/34E92353DFE94E9DB4BB55C777DFD054-2.png)

I can't verify their validity, but if these are accurate it appears fairly reasonable to guess that incremental tax brackets won't be changing dramatically in the next few decades. If I am understanding trends shown in the linked charts, if I'm in a higher income tax bracket at retirement, then I will be paying lower taxes than now and if I'm in a lower income tax bracket at retirement (which is more likely if I haven't developed passive income) I will be paying higher taxes than now.

The more important point, as shown in the math above, is that for the average person, *tax rates* matter less than *post-tax ('tax-free') gains.* That is to say: the amount you gain in a post-tax retirement account will usually be more than the amount you save by a lower effective tax rate in a pre-tax retirement account, even in a top tax bracket.

Of course this is not a guarantee. Your Roths could be invested poorly, there could be a revolution and the entire tax structure we've had for the last century could be changed to a universal standard tax rate, you could win the lottery, etc. but at some point we have to accept that we're dealing with probabilities. If you haven't developed a cumulatively progressive source of passive income *and* you're not in a defined hierarchy (ie. a partnership track in a law firm or medical group, a path to senior management at a large corporation, etc) or you sell a product that can be leveraged to economies of scale (ie. a brand-name app), you will probably be in an eat-what-you-kill situation at retirement and so be making less in retirement than you are in middle age.

\-

**5th point to dispute: That there are universal solutions. Remember:** ***one size fits all is a size that fits none.***

**A comment I've come across is that having both a traditional IRA and a Roth is good because you're ""diversifying"".** The reasoning behind this is that a traditional IRA will be counted as part of taxable income in retirement and a Roth can be used for additional tax-free withdrawals that would put one out of their desired tax bracket.

This doesn't make sense as a general rule and must be calculated for your individual circumstances. By my own personal math, for example, it is a bad idea for me to do a traditional IRA because the lower tax rate at retirement would not compensate for the tax-free gains of a Roth. This is an example of where something that sounds like good advice (ie. ""It's always good to diversify."") actually takes you down a less financially successful path. If you're referring to diversification relative to the unknowability of future tax rates, this is what I was discussing in point 4 above.

Another point to keep in mind is that your year to year tax situation matters a great deal. Let's say you retire early, get laid off or have a year where you are transitioning jobs so your income is low. This is a great opportunity for a Roth IRA conversion ladder -- ie. moving your pre-tax (IRA/401k) money into to post tax (Roth) accounts. Use this year as an opportunity to pay the lower effective tax rate at deposit *and* get the benefits of post-tax gains. A double-whammy of tax gains.

Looking at your specific life circumstances make it more likely that you will pick the retirement portfolio that applies to your particular path. Barring extreme examples, however, a Roth will be the better choice for most.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit to add:** Thank you for the discussion. Based on comments I've had to eat some crow and add some points.

* I make the assumption in my calculations that the Roth is maxed out and that the additional available cash at the time of investment with the traditional IRA is not reinvested. Some don't think this is fair to the theoretical comparison. This is a fair point, though I think viewing the numbers as I am is far closer to reality for medium to high income earners because they it is a functional redistribution of savings -- a lot of retirement strategy revolves around **arbitrage**.
* If the additional available cash for a traditional IRA holder was reinvested, it would be subject to a capital gains tax (based on its turnover) and eventual withdrawal. It seems preferable to allow this money to grow post-tax/tax-free at a faster rate without **capital gains turnover lag**.
* Regarding capital gains lag -- some comments have suggested that I'm exaggerating the impact of capital gains lag for a non-tax advantaged account. This is not an opinion. Here are some numbers:
   * Of the 10% gains that the S&amp;P reports yearly:
      * → On average, 2-4% of these gains are dividends depending on your time frame for historical data→ 20% of these dividends, in turn, are taxed in capital gains (in the highest tax bracket)→ Gains would be 9.6% overall each year in a taxed account in a 2% dividends scenario (8% + 1.6%).→ This is as opposed to a Roth where the gains would be the entire 10% each year because they are entirely post-tax or a trad where they're pre-tax.
   * So we would be looking at:
      * 1.10\^30 \* 100k = $1.704 million with a tax advantaged account
      * 1.096\^30 \* 100k = $1.561 million with a standard index fund with dividends of 2%
      * 1.092\^30 \* 100k = 1.401 million with a standard index fund with dividends of 4%
   * The degree of lag correlates directly with dividends, plus you are taxed at the time of withdrawal. Non-tax advantaged accounts are literally a poor man's Roth.
* If someone is not able to max out their investment account the math would need to be readjusted to take this into account.
* I corrected some math with regards to effective and marginal tax rates.
* I didn't take into account required minimum distributions and will do so with a future spreadsheet.
* The only way for higher income earners to access a Roth is via a backdoor conversion. The Ways and Means Committee in Congress is currently evaluating whether to discontinue this route so that they can meet their budget requirements -- if they do so, backdoor Roth conversions will be discontinued after 12/31/21:

&gt;A provision in the November 3rd version of the Build Back Better (BBB) bill focuses on limiting tax-avoidance strategies favored by the rich. Some of these were exposed in a recent [Propublica investigative report](https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank), most notably the $5 billion Roth IRA owned by Paypal founder Peter Thiel.  
&gt;  
&gt;“These policies are designed to level the playing field a little bit,” said Brent Lipschultz, a partner in EisnerAmper’s Personal Wealth Group.  
&gt;  
&gt;These provisions had been yanked out of a previous version of the bill, then it was reinserted as negotiations continued among Democratic Party factions in Congress. With luck, it will stay in the bill, but anything can change.

Assuming literally anyone at my school is interested, any ideas for how to simulate investing and a good incentive?|"I've already got a good idea for some structures I could go for:

* I could go for a structure of 20 minutes spent teaching people about something, depending on previous knowledge, ranging from talking about stocks and ETFs to options or crypto staking/minig/trading, followed by 40 minutes of discussing investment strategies and the news relating to it.
* It could be a glorified social club with some fianncial discussion and news.
* It could be like a financial firm simulation, where I take $100 out of my current investment account and use a brokerage with fractional shares, where everyone pitches a stock or ETF, similar to the concept going on at r/InvestmentClub.
* I'm thinking of making a competition where everyone sets up a demo account and the person with the most money/assets at the end of some given time periods wins some prize. This won't take any club time, however, because school hours run through market hours.
* I could entirely steer clear of investments and go over only safe money-making ways like bank savings accounts, and go over general things of how to manage your money.

Hoping for some input on what y'all think may be the best idea if I'm looking to attract some high-schoolers into learning about fiannces and ideally making money! Part of what's in it for me and what motivates me to look into it is that teaching others and having others in real life to discuss things with makes me more motivated to care about investing, trading, and generally making money through the purchasing, holding, and selling, of assets (and I like hearing myself talk when I believe it's something that will benefit people :) )."|0.81|67.0|0.0|67.0|['r/InvestmentClub']

I have a close relationship with an old professor of mine (he has a doctorate in finance and has amassed serious wealth) who teaches investments at the college level, we often chat. He was a derivatives trader for 20 years back in the 80s and 90s.

He swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit, and most if not all valuations will drop. He says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since ‘08 and the withdrawals will be severe. He has been slowly divesting the past few months.

I see where he is coming from, and he is obviously much wiser than me. In class he would always preach about if a stock falls 50% you need 100% gain to make your money back, therefore avoiding downside is much better than missing a little upside, which I also agree with.

What I am not so sure of is that rising rates will spell doom for the markets. The most I could see is maybe slowed growth? But if rates steadily climb to around 4% on the 10 year that would actually be GOOD For the economy.

Thoughts on this? Inb4 “long term time horizon I never sell”

Edit: following up due to traction. This guys worst year was 2000 where he made -2%, which still massively outperformed the market. I understand the never sell mentality, but look at the facts: rates are at rock bottom, QE is off the charts. There is literally only ONE direction the fed can go. I predict rates will begin to rise (slowly) at some point next year. If you had a chance to miss massive downside, would you take it? Can you use logic to make prudent investment decisions or are you locked into never mitigating risk? I am actually beginning to consider slowly exiting. The risks are starting to compound significantly.

Fundamentals about silver say two things: With increasing use for EV, electronics and solar panels silver is not only a monetary metal like gold, but also an industrial metal with increasing demand from these industries.

„Traditionally, silver prices have tracked gold prices fairly closely, which makes sense given that both function as monetary metals, and they often occur together in mineral deposits. The correlation between gold and silver since 1975 has been 0.8876. The 10-year correlation coefficient is 0.7511. However this year, the correlation has dropped significantly to 0.1959. The reason is the fact that both copper and silver are being increasingly demanded in green energy applications.“

(https://www.mining.com/web/silver-seen-tracking-copper-prices-higher/)

Other than Gold, Silver is increasingly used by industry:

After a bearish trend silver seems to have found a bottom and technical indicators turn bullish.

Looking at the supply situation it must be noted that Silver is mined mostly as a byproduct from other mining operations, but Silver is limited.

A rising demand meets a limited supply.

Statistics:

https://www.statista.com/topics/1335/silver/#topicHeader__wrapper

The question remains, will this scenario result in rising silver prices or can the price remain where it is? 

Commodities and miners are risky investments and especially Silver is very volatile, but prices are low and create an investment possibility as well as a diversification to tech stocks.

I am currently holding Barrick Gold whose total preliminary gold production[ rose to 1.09 million ounces](https://www.reuters.com/business/barrick-third-quarter-gold-output-rises-nearly-5-sequentially-2021-10-14/) and Newmont, which is another big company that generates massive production of precious metals. The latter was recently among stocks that can possibly beat inflation.

Right now I’m looking into going for some [First Majestic](https://www.firstmajestic.com/) not just for the gold but also since they have the most expensive silver stock out there. Another one would be Equinox Gold since they are showing a lot of potential too. Their operations are not deterred by the pandemic, so they are constantly producing and is possibly headed for a breakout.

For explorations, I think [Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) has a lot of room to grow. They already started drilling and have released good results in the recent months. The cash burn is so low and the company is set up for a long timeline. So far that’s the only one I’m going to look into since they’re already showing promise in their drilling results. I also want to be safe so I’m more focused on the bigger ones since they’re more certain and I don’t think I’d lose that much on them.

WASHINGTON—A trading frenzy in shares of GameStop Corp. [US:GME] shares earlier this year raised a number of questions for regulators but didn’t expose major weaknesses in stock-market infrastructure, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday.

A highly anticipated SEC report attributed the episode primarily to a rapid increase in trading by individual investors, many of whom used social-media platforms like Reddit to swap ideas and strategies. The agency poured cold water on a number of alternative hypotheses for why the struggling videogame retailer’s share price soared from less than $20 at the end of 2020 to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28.

The SEC also found no evidence to support theories that gained traction on social media around brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc.’s [US:HOOD] decision to restrict trading in GameStop and other so-called meme stocks that day.

The SEC said shortening the amount of time it takes for brokers to clear equity trades from the current period of two days could make the market less risky during times of heightened volatility. It also said more reporting of short sales—a method of betting a stock’s price will decline—could help regulators monitor markets."|0.93|1549.0|0.0|1549.0|['US', 'the Securities and Exchange Commission', 'Reddit', 'GME', 'GameStop', 'GameStop Corp.', 'Robinhood Markets Inc.’s']

This is the biggest decline since February, when Winter Storm Uri  wreaked havoc in Texas. Manufacturing had been a bright spot even though  the sector is struggling with supply bottlenecks.

Flooding in the coal hub of Shanxi province have driven prices up to $234 a metric ton as the government tries to kickstart extra production, further measures are needed to prevent more generators cutting off their turbines and causing blackouts through northern China’s winter. That means a crackdown on the factories that still consume the majority of electricity.  Industry makes up 25% of grid demand in the U.S., in China it’s 59%  — more than all the country’s homes, offices and retail stores put together. Cheap power has been essential for development in China. The problem now is that coal is very expensive. The world relies on cheap Chinese power for making its goods. About half of all metal is produced in China and, a fifth of all oil is refined there. Energy-hungry products from aluminum to solar panels depend on the country's low industrial power tariffs to keep their prices down. With electricity costs for dual-high industries set to rise, we may not have seen the end of the inflationary pressures flowing through the global economy.  That’s where renewables come in. At the same time that price curbs are being removed from industries, capacity curbs are being lifted from zero-carbon power generation. With zero-carbon electricity already cheaper than most existing operating coal power plants, those changes may be just the spur to wean China from solid fuels.

t3_q9czb0|1634394155.0|investing|Why is simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing the last 3 decades of stock market data to find the best DCA strategy|"By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that

&gt;Time in the market beats timing the market

But what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.

**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**

So in this week’s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!

___ 

**Analysis**

Given that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price &amp; Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \[1\].

Now we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)

**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)

**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \[2\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \[3\]

**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \[4\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills

**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \[5\].

Given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it’s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY. 

___

**Results**

Based on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.

**Return Comparison - Different DCA Strategies** 

|**Investment Strategy**|**Portfolio** |**Investment Strategy**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Average Joe|$169,036|406%|
|Analyst Alan - 1% drop|$168,129|403%|
|Analyst Alan - 3% drop|$166,658|399%|
|Balanced Barry|$162,150|385%|
|Analyst Alan - 5% drop|$154,441|362%|
|Analyst Alan - 10% drop|$146,392|388%|
|Cautious Charlie|$139,696|318%|

 

No matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.

The least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.

___

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to the analysis.

a. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns

b. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).

c. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years’ worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.

___ 

**Conclusion**

I started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \[5,10, 20 years\] and various endpoints \[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.

Since this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.

___ 

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.

\[2\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&amp;P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.

\[3\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds

\[4\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends

t3_q8phxf|1634307758.0|investing|$GWH has potential to be the future of renewable battery tech|"Hi guys, lucky for me, GWH came onto my radar two weeks ago when I was looking into the plans for Sun Cable, an Australian plan to provide up to 15% of Singapores daily electricity needs via massive solar farms and an undersea cable.

The main challenge with renewables at the moment is battery storage. Renewables are now the cheapest power source available but face massive constraints in the form of consistent supply and grid smoothing. Lithium ion mega storages are currently the answer but have many drawbacks. High fire risk, 4 hour max storage, fast degradation, high price, environmentally damaging disposal and need for cooling.

Enter ESS storage ($GWH) an iron flow battery made of Iron and electrolytes and salt water. Iron flow batteriy is a type of electrochemical cell where chemical energy is provided by two chemical components dissolved in liquids that are pumped through the system on separate sides of a membrane.\[2\]\[3\] Ion exchange (accompanied by flow of electric current) occurs through the membrane while both liquids circulate in their own respective space. (wikipedia)

ESS could be the future for renewable storage and billionaire backers like Bill Gates are all over the future tech ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/11/ess-battery-company-backed-by-bill-gates-softbank-opens-on-nyse.html)). It has a very reasonable 70% round trip efficiency, meaning it loses 30% of the power you put into it.

ESS has a few advantages over lithium ion; No need for cooling so can be used in hot environments like Texas, Australia, California. Extremely cheap source materials. Storage up to 10 hours. 20,000 cycle life and NO storage degradation versus 5000 cycle life for lithium ion.

The downside I can see for this stock are new battery techs stealing market share. Slow adoption of renewables. Or potentially extreme price drop in lithium ion cost, tech or safety.

I am long on this stock

Something curious I noticed this morning is GHW had a high short borrow fee (130%) whilst there are only 4.3 million shares available for public trading due to 180 day lockup([https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh\_ess\_tech\_backed\_by\_bill\_gates\_and\_me\_started/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/q6c8gl/gwh_ess_tech_backed_by_bill_gates_and_me_started/)). GWH has already squeezed once. The reason GWH squeezed initially is because a lot of people are shorting SPACs as they have fallen out of favour to investors recently AND GWH had a high redemption of shares (bailing out of the SPAC)

I am long on this company so squeezes do not interest me too much but it is something to note."|0.35|0.0|0.0|0.0|['GHW', 'GWH', 'Sun Cable']

t3_q81ghf|1634223596.0|investing|Future of payment cards (Visa/Mastercard/Amex/Discovery)|"Hello everyone. 

Recently I have been thinking and reading about the payment processing sector and its undergoing changes, which can, in my opinion, affect the future of card networks.

As many might know companies like Visa earn an interchange fee every time me and you utilize a debit/credit card to buy something, effectively acting as a middleman between us and the merchant.

Of course this proved to be  a very successful business as most of us have one or more debit/credit cards, and that their stock prices have skyrocketed over the decade. 

However I am wondering whether the incredible growth for card companies is sustainable, and that, perhaps, we are close to reach a plateau. 

Before jumping to the bear case for cards think about China. Payments with cards are almost non-existent given the dominance of Wechat Pay and Alipay.

I believe similar things are happening in the US as well. Think about Cash App, Venmo, Paypal, all now allow people to transact utilizing QR codes, potentially bypassing the Card Networks. I say potentially because often we still link our debit/credit cards to our mobile apps. But I believe that as transfer of funds get easier, people could potentially start utilizing the available funds stored in their apps to conduct the transaction, effectively bypassing Card Networks. I believe also that Paypal and co. would prefer us to utilize stored value instead of cards when conducting payments, as they would not have to share any fees with MA or V.

Now. I don't live in the US. So I am not sure about the frequency of shops that allow consumers to buy through QR codes, but from what a read the number has been increasing since the outbreak of Covid-19. Furthermore, payment processing companies like Adyen/Stripe could potentially easily enable merchants to toggle a switch and activate the QR payments offered by Venmo/Cashapp/Paypal (similarly to how they enable Wechat Pay/Alipay). 

Of course if people go travel overseas cards will remain the first choice of payment. But who knows. In the long future a tourist shop in London could potentially accept Venmo/Cash App QR payments (supposing that they gained significant popularity in the US) if they expect significant number of US customers. Similarly to how may shops (particularly luxury retailers) in the US are accepting Alipay/Wechat Pay.

Now this is a very short summary on what I believe might disrupt card networks. However, I have to say that this does not mean that card networks are going to die, instead, in the short to mid-term they will probably keep growing. However, I believe that in the long-term they are poised for disruption, as new payment methods that can potentially bypass them might gain popularity.

Hope I was able to convey my thoughts clearly. What do you guys think? Personally I have some money in MA. And I have to say that this transformation in the payment processing industry is both exiting and scary (as a MA shareholder).

 TL;DR 

1) Credit/Debit cards might be disrupted by new payment methods that bypasses their network.

2) Credit/Debit cards will not die or disappear. But growth might be reduced."|0.83|36.0|0.0|36.0|['MA', 'Wechat Pay', 'Paypal', 'Alipay', 'Venmo', 'the Card Networks', 'Adyen/Stripe', 'Card Networks', 'Venmo/Cashapp/Paypal', 'Visa']
t3_q821sx|1634225343.0|investing|Invested in a bad actor? You might be entitled to free money(!)|"Earlier this year I saw something online somewhere about a class action suit against $INFN, and since I live by the motto ""always join the settlement class"" I submitted my contact info to the law firm filing the suit. I ended up agreeing to be a lead plaintiff.

Infinera settled before going to trial, but the lawyers secured me an incentive award from the courts as part of the settlement, as compensation for being a lead plaintiff. I was honestly expecting to get like 15 bucks thrown my way if there was a settlement - over the years I've received several settlement awards, a few for $100 or $200 but the vast majority end up being &lt;$25, and I've never been lead plaintiff before and didn't have any idea what to expect - so I was completely surprised when **they sent me a $1,000 check!!** 

I can't stress enough how little effort was required on my part. I signed an agreement to let them represent me, sent them redacted PDF copy of my brokerage statement to confirm I owned the shares during the settlement period, and sent maybe 3 one-sentence emails over a period of about 3 months authorizing them to take each of steps they advised taking on my behalf. I paid nothing out of pocket and here's the real kicker: I only held like $300 worth of $INFN, it was little more than a bet I placed for funsies. A surprise 3-bagger over just a 1 year holding period!

Today I learned of another class action lawsuit against a company I placed a $200 bet on earlier this year ($APPH), which is currently down -66%. Even if I just recover some of the \~$130 lost it'd be worth it for how little effort is involved, but if I get asked to be lead plaintiff again and the incentive award is $1,000 again, or even $500 or $250, I'll be thrilled!

I was represented by a firm that specializes in these type of shareholder class actions and has several cases going at a time. [You can scroll through a list of them on their website to see if you hold shares in any companies in litigation.](https://www.zlk.com/press) A Google search indicates there are also several other law firms that do the same thing, but I don't have experience with any of the others, so I'm putting it on my to-do list to see what cases other firms are working on!

I feel like I probably sound like a shill because I'm so enthusiastic but hopefully my Reddit history makes it clear that I'm just an ordinary investor who stumbled into free money(!!) this year and wanted to share the good news with the good people here."|0.58|10.0|0.0|10.0|['INFN', '&', 'Infinera', '$']

To my understanding, they are credits that allow companies to pollute the environment to a certain extent each year and companies that don’t pollute that much can sell their credits to other companies. The idea is that in the future, governments can basically reduce the carbon allowances of all companies (essentially reducing supply) and the price per carbon credit will rise accordingly. I am assuming that eventually (or maybe even currently, I literally cannot find much) that carbon credits are a need for certain companies that are under the jurisdictions of where this system has been implemented, meaning companies will have to buy and sell carbon credits. 

That’s what I understood from this concept, did I get it right? And if I did, what are the barriers to carbon credits that might stop it from being a good investment?

- Earnings of $3.74 per share vs. $3 per share estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

- Revenue: $30.44 billion vs $29.8 billion estimate.

The gain came after the bank released $2.1 billion in reserves and had $524 million of net chargeoffs in the quarter, New York based JPMorgan said in a release. The bank produced $3.74 per share in earnings, which includes a 52 cent per share boost from reserve releases and a 19 cent per share benefit tied to a tax filing.

The bank “delivered strong results as the economy continues to show good growth - despite the dampening effect of the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in the statement. “We released credit reserves of $2.1 billion as the economic outlook continues to improve and our scenarios have improved accordingly.”"|0.95|966.0|0.0|966.0|['Refinitiv', 'JPMorgan']

I think I'm set with a retirement account, I deduct 10% to a 401K with a 6% company match to a VG target date 2050 fund which has been growing over the last 8 years. I have modeled my brokerage account with my retirement account and have 4 ETFs, an S&amp;P 500 index fund, a US mid cap index fund, a total world EX US index fund, and an intermediate term US treasury bond index fund. VOO 50%, VXF20%, VEU 20%, VGIT 10%. (apparenty I'm a Vanguard fanboy because they have the lowest fees)

I have been using [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/) to gauge my asset allocations, and have noticed that a long term treasury bond ETF (VGLT) would do better in all timeframes from 1995 to today in terms of total return, and standard deviation, as well as reduced the losses from the tech bubble, and the housing market crash.

The problem is that all the reading I have done recommends avoiding long term treasury bond ETFs. I see that corporate bonds have a positive correlation with the stock market, and have avoided them since realizing that. It seems to me that a long term treasury ETF will offset the losses from a sharp stock downturn. I imagine that the US government will adjust interest rates, plus the demand for  bonds over stocks in a recession, will increase the yield and price of the longest term treasury bonds, nicely offsetting the downturn in the stock market. Long term bonds have greater volatility, but is negatively correlated to the US stock market. My reading says that short term treasury bonds are best, and I don't know why.

I'm aware many despise AT&amp;T - this is an objective view - not saying buy/hold/sell, just want to discuss.

Current Share Price = $25.42 / Current Dividend = 8.81% / Annual Dividend = $2.08.

Projected dividend after the Warner bros/Disc deal = $1.11 per share annualized.

Projected yield after the merger at current price = 4.4%.

Assuming the following:

* 7.1 billion AT&amp;T shares on issue
* Value of Warner bros Discovery 120 bil (High), 100 bil (mid), 80 bil (low) and 60 bil (conservative)
* T shareholders get 70% of shares in new company
* Dividend after merger cut to $1.11 per share

With the following calculation:

(value of new company \* 70%) / 7.1 billion shares on issue = Value of new company per AT&amp;T share

So...

1. (120 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $11.83 per share (High value)
2. (100 billion \* 70%) / 7.1billion = $9.85 per share (Mid value)
3. (80 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $7.88 per share (Low value)
4. (60 billion \* 70%) / 7.1 billiion = $5.91 per share (Conservative value)

So... at the current valuation assuming no price change after merget

1. High value = $37.25 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T 25.43)
2. Mid Value = $35.27
3. Low Value = $33.3
4. Conservative Value= $31.00

Extra scenario 1 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 6% (to be 1% higher than near competitor Verizon which has a safer dividend... = T Share price of $18.5

1. High value = $30.33 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $18.5)
2. Mid Value = $28.35
3. Low Value = $26.38
4. Conservative Value= $24.41

Extra scenario 2 - assume that AT&amp;T price drops to maintain a dividend yield of at least 7% (restored to the beloved 7%) = T Share price of $15.85

1. High value = $27.68 ($11.83 per share of warner disc + AT&amp;T $15.85)
2. Mid Value = $25.7
3. Low Value = $23.78
4. Conservative Value= $21.76

You might remember my post from a couple years ago: [Warren Buffett Value Investing Cheat Sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9ur0g6/warren_buffett_value_investing_cheat_sheet_a/).

After I discovered the power of the checklist, a few criteria quickly grew into a quantitative handbook. Investing with a checklist saved me time, decreased stress, and improved my returns.

Below is the complete version of the well-received Investing Cheat Sheet.  Are there any other criteria I'm missing? What metrics do you look for? I'm specifically interested in fleshing out the impact checklist (Sustainability).

Note: You will not find a company that fits EVERY criteria. The aim is to build portfolios targeting individual checklists (factors). Portfolios targeting individual checklists should give you good diversification, especially if invested across geographies.

1. Value
2. Efficiency
3. Health
4. Dividend
5. Growth
6. Ratings
7. Technical

11. Questions

# QUESTIONS

Stay away from qualitative judgement as much as you can. But if you must:

☐ Can I say in one sentence what the company does?

☐ Does the company have a competitive advantage / moat?

☐ Does the company have few / no competitors?

☐ Is the company within my circle of competence?

☐ Have I read at least the most recent earnings report?

☐ Do I trust / like the management?

☐ Does the company have a credit rating of at least BB?

☐ Do I like this company?

☐ Is the company ethical?

☐ Does this company give me international exposure?

☐ Will this company be around in 20 years?

☐ If the stock market closed tomorrow for the next five years, would I still buy this company?

☐ Will this company help diversify my portfolio?

☐ Does the company treat its employees well?

☐ Are insiders buying shares?

☐ Is the industry and company sustainable?

☐ Is the company still growing?

☐ Are analysts optimistic about the company?

☐ Is the stock ""screaming"" cheap?

☐ Can I say in one paragraph why I am buying this company?

☐ Do I have an exit strategy?

&amp;#x200B;

# HOW TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO WITH THE CHECKLISTS (6 Steps):

Step 1. Choose the amount to invest *(eg. $10,000)*  
Make sure you've thought about:

* Have a six month emergency cash pile
* Pay off high interest debt first
* Eliminate your worst spending habits
* Think about your time horizon
* Max out your pension contributions

Step 2. Choose your markets *(eg. US - All industries)*

* Industries
* Countries

Step 3. Choose the company size *(eg. Microcap)*

* Nano-cap (&lt;$50M)
* Micro-cap (&lt;$300M)
* Small-cap (&lt;$2B)
* Mid-cap (&lt;$10B)
* Large-cap (&lt;$200B)
* Mega-cap (&gt;$200B)

Step 4. Filter based on the checklists above *(eg. P/S &lt; 1 and Positive 3&amp;6-month Momentum)*

Step 5. Rank the remaining companies by another metric *(eg. Rank by 1-Year Price Momentum)*

Step 6. Pick &amp; purchase stocks from the top of the list *(eg. Purchase top 25 stocks)*

Backtested results: $10,000 invested in 1965 into the strategy above would have grown to $95M today. An 18.1% annual return. The S&amp;P500 would have returned $1M in the same period, an 8.79% return.

&amp;#x200B;

This took me a long time to compile... I hope you derive value from it. Enjoy!"|0.94|356.0|0.0|356.0|['&', 'amp', 'Reddit']

t3_q5jsdf|1633910175.0|investing|If you're young and have a very long investment horizon, then investing in stocks using leverage DECREASES your risk|"""While leveraged purchases of stock increase short-term risk, it reduces long-term risk by letting individuals achieve better diversification across time.

Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies—both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments.

The expected retirement wealth is 84% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 20% higher compared to 100% stock investments. Relative to traditional life-cycle investments, the expected gain from this improved asset allocation would allow workers to retire 9 years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement for an additional 20 years. For a worker with CRRA=2, the increased retirement consumption raises lifetime utility by 7.3%. The potential gains are substantial...

We recognize that our recommendation to begin with leverage positions goes against conventional advice. And yet, our recommendation flows directly from the basic Samuelson and Merton lifecycle savings model. It is also supported by the data. We will 2 show that following this advice leads to higher returns with lower risks. This is true both for historical data and for a variety of Monte Carlo simulations.""

source: [https://www.tau.ac.il/law/BuyingStocks.pdf](https://www.tau.ac.il/law/BuyingStocks.pdf)

Quite an interesting paper, basically it says if you're young, leveraging actually decreases risk. \*Because you're diversifying across time\*. Most people have too much invested when old, and too little invested in stocks when young. Leverage allows them to have more invested in the markets while young, while slowly deleveraging when they get older.

&amp;#x200B;

Leverage can be acheived in multiple ways. Levered ETFs (SSO) gives you 3x the daily results of the S&amp;P 500. If you look at the 10-15+ year time horizon of SSO you would have drastically outperformed VOO/VTI. You can also buy stocks on margin, or use option calls, to acheive a 2:1 leverage. The paper recommends being 200% in stocks at maximum.

They’ve become less interested in the debt’s size, and more focused on what it costs. With occasional hops and bounces, [30 years treasury yields](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETYX?p=%5ETYX) have been on a pretty steady decline since 1985, which makes borrowing ever-cheaper. 

Treasury secretary Yellen said that even though the amount of debt relative to the economy has risen, the interest burden - the amount the Treasury pays to service its debt - has not, due to lower interest rates.

[If it were possible to take interest rates into negative territory I would be voting for that.](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/711345) \- Janet Yellen, ""Why Gold Is Unstoppable"" by Doug French, [www.caseyresearch.com](https://www.caseyresearch.com). March 19, 2014.

On the other hand, Michael Burry is betting that interest rates are about to go up.

Let's assume FED raises interest rates, that brings up the question: How are we gonna service the debt if borrowing costs get increasingly more expensive? It seems like a debt death spiral - the more expensive borrowing is, the more debt you need to take to service it.

t3_q53rsc|1633853030.0|investing|Long term population trends, implication for real estate and other markets|"Was thinking tonight about how real estate has continued to become more and more expensive, (i.e. a good investment) over the past 70 years. However that price run up has been predicated both on the largest population explosion in human history, as well as artificial construction of supply, by NIMBYs and zoning laws in many parts of the world. 

I’ve always assumed that, aside from occasional collapses, real estate will continue to drift upwards, perhaps not a great investment compared to other assets, but better than inflation. 

The possibility exists of long term reversal of both of these supporting trends. Zoning laws are becoming threatened due to political backlash from how unaffordable housing has become. At the same time life in general has become so unaffordable that fertility rates are now strongly below replacement values in most of the developed world. 

Can’t say anything with any certainty of course, but I think a future of continued growth of housing prices for the next century isn’t a guarantee. Sounds obvious when I write it out, but psychologically I had a deep seated assumption that the housing market was a guaranteed success long term.  Think that may require a rethink. 

If population trends down in the developed world, that’s a possible future to consider when choosing investments. Fewer people could depress real prices of stocks in general.  Kind of difficult to know what types of companies would perform well in this scenario. I suppose technology companies specializing in automation (AI and robotics) is the only market I can think of that would do well. Commodities, construction, non-durables, energy, all of those seem to be at risk from a general long-term decline in population and therefore in aggregate demand. 

Again not saying this will happen, but personally I feel as though I had not given enough thought to this."|0.84|85.0|0.0|85.0|[]

But it seems - almost - every time there's a split, there's an increase in the stocks price as people buy in at the cheaper price, and maybe others sell X% after the split. What's stopping a company from splitting their stock often versus rarely?

If I had a company and I was adamant at keeping the stock low, could I split the stock every time it got to $100, so that it was around $50? Then after that split it jetted up to $100 within a year, could I split it again or would I have to wait for X years or some predetermined length of time?

t3_q3o1f6|1633658717.0|investing|Why investors should not be worried about the expansion of the money supply causing inflation in four easy charts.|" 

**Introduction**: There has been a lot of discussion as to the increase in money supply and inflation. Most seem to think that an increase in M2 inevitably leads to inflation in prices of goods and services. This couldn't be further from the truth. There was previously a strong correlation between the two up until 1990. From then on, the correlation has reversed and is negative. There is now a much stronger relationship between increases in the money supply and decreases in the velocity of money, meaning that money is not moving through the economy as it once did. This means that increases in the money supply are not getting spent. And as we all know, money must be spent to cause inflation. This is why economists are not overly concerned about the recent rapid rise in the money supply causing inflation.

So here are the four easy charts:

1. This [first chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=809733064&amp;format=image) shows the correlation between the adjusted money supply and inflation. The M2 money supply is adjusted by subtracting real GDP. This amounts to the excess money beyond what is needed to grow real GDP. This has the strongest correlation with inflation. Inflation is measured by the implicit GDP price deflator, which measures the actual items that were spent in the year vs. a previous year's base price. You can use PCE or CPI, but the relationship is very similar. (Also I'm using an 8 year moving average because this gives the strongest correlation between the two variables. The correlation is very weak in concurrent periods, and gets a little stronger using 2 and 4 year moving averages.) You can see from this chart that the correlation was very strong from 1968, the first year of the 8 year moving average, through the end of 1990. R = 0.95 and R\^2 = 0.90. This indicates that 90% of changes in inflation can be explained by the changes in the adjusted money supply. This strong relationship has lead the general public to believe that the two variables are inherently related: That is, that the expansion of the adjusted money supply inevitably leads to inflation.
2. The [second chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQY4owBA5SP28Ng2glt_fG0jnDXTgwvsp-Q90VTA5_TTqrSZQRjkUTZeE1Zt5BOSxCnkHz-TX6HWu2z/pubchart?oid=2061624488&amp;format=image) shows the correlation from 1991-2021. You can clearly see that the relationship reversed. R= -0.50 R\^2 = 0.25. This indicates that the rate of inflation decreases as the adjusted money supply increases. It shows a moderate to weak relationship in which the increase in the adjusted money supply explains about 25% of the decrease in the rate of inflation. This can probably be explained by the fact that the money supply has seen its largest increases in periods when the economy was in recession and prices were falling. Needless to say, you can see that the former relationship between these two variables does NOT exist anymore and hasn't for 30 years!
3. This [third chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=997615969&amp;format=image) shows the relationship between changes in adjusted money supply and changes in the velocity of money from 1960-1990. The velocity of money is the frequency of monetary transactions in the economy. You can clearly see that the relationship is negative, as the adjusted money supply increases, the number of transactions decreases. R = -0.63 R\^2 = 0.40. This indicates that 40% of the decrease in the velocity of money can be explained by the increase in the adjusted money supply. This is a moderately strong relationship.
4. This [last chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlyD-2fO9g1W3h6VFXV_r-CJo5MdLourVfNF5HMo_uG-8s1Rpu2293GA-_3LkBGbF_WM0CkWI61zXx/pubchart?oid=946401508&amp;format=image) shows the correlation of adjusted money supply and the velocity of money from 1991-2021. R= -0.98 R\^2 = 0.97. This indicates the strengthening of the relationship between increases in adjusted money supply and decreases in the velocity of money. You can clearly see that the more money that is pushed into the economy the less frequent that money gets spent.

**So where is all this money going if it is not going into goods and services?** Economist largely believe that increases in the money supply probably inflate assets, including real estate, stocks, bonds and all other capital and financial assets. PE ratios have been on the rise for 30 years now. The average TTM PE ratio from 1928-1990 was 13.8 times. Since then it is 21x. The 10-year treasury yield from 1928-1990 averaged 5.17%. Since then 4.19%, and 3% in the last 20 years. The are further examples, but I think you can see that the decoupling of the money supply and inflation has probably benefited asset prices.

**TLDR**: Increasing the money supply does NOT lead to inflation in products and services like it once did. It now results in a lower velocity of money, more savings and higher asset prices."|0.75|180.0|0.0|180.0|[]

This is in all aspects, a retail supported stock. 99.3 million shares if fully diluted. That leaves 93 million shares being represented by people like you and me. Francis Dube, CEO from 2019-2020 was an activist shareholder that helped remove the terrible previous management in 2018 and pushed the R&amp;D development and continues to be a face for the company. Greg Fenton, CEO, has been purchasing massively from the market over the past years. This year he bought $500k in shares, while his salary is only $137k.

It is currently classified as a Mining stock, with the Albany deposit being the primary focus. This is dead wrong, as they have been in R&amp;D for Graphene applications for the past 3 years.

They are available for order, shipping TBD since production will primarily come online toward November with majority of product going to high priority areas like Hospitals, and nursing homes. [vitalhealthsupplies.ca](https://vitalhealthsupplies.ca/home/). Management has specified that they are pursuing the Healthcare sector primarily but have significant other opportunities.

Expects to reach a production capacity toward 9-10 billion in coating equivalent for masks come November, which could go to use on HVAC filters, gloves, and high-touch surfaces as these applications seek approval in 2022. Currently, management estimates they will receive earnings of $0.03-$0.06/mask. Global mask usage is estimated to remain toward 930 billion masks per year or similarly elevated levels for the foreseeable future. If they were to capture just 1% of the current mask market,

**they could see** ***$270-$540*** **mil** **in 2022**, as EPS, ***$3-$5, the current stock price.*** Giving me a ***PT for later 2022 of $40*** or more from P/E projectability alone and disregarding any other potentials for the new year.

There are massive changes coming, and management is very transparent with their plans. It's hard not to be optimistic when everything is laid out in front of you, while management outwardly expresses that they are undervalued.. and I tend to agree. There is little investor exposure, due to it being listed as a mining stock. Tech/healthcare followers would be far more interested. Uplistings to NASDAQ/TSX are expected later this year/2022. It has been stated by management, that institutions in the U.S. simply cannot invest in ZEN due to it being on the pink sheets, Institutional ownership, again is at 0.03%. There is significant interest by these institutions, and I anticipate Uplistings to be a catalyst of their own due to the liquidity increase.

What is it worth when they offer a extremely effective solution to air quality for personal protection and passive filtration?

When they offer a potential medicine that kills bacteria, viruses, and fungus?

When they offer rapid-aptamer fluid derived tests for virtually every pathogen?

The first thing I found while this up was [Forge Global](https://forgeglobal.com/forge-markets/), a company that basically sells employee option shares of private companies, but they had tight requirements such as over $1 net worth and rigid terms for holding (12 months post-IPO). [Cap light](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/is-buying-and-selling-short-positions-in-private-companies-next-this-fintech-startup-is-banking-on-it/), another start-up that trades equity derivatives for pre-IPO securities, solved the issue with holding period, but had the same issues with net worth.

In the crypto verse, I found tokens of stocks by Mirror, FTX and Bittrex, so no issues with holding or minimum net worth, but they're simply mirroring existing markets, so no pre IPO stuff. The closest thing I found to invest/ trade in private companies was [prepo](https://simulator.prepo.io/), but they're not live yet.

Is there any solid way to invest/ trade private companies?

t3_q3i1kg|1633638954.0|investing|Some Thoughts on Long-Term Macro Trends|"1. Low interest rates correspond to higher stock prices and cheaper real estate ([P&amp;I on a 30-year fixed mortgage for a median price home is currently cheaper than most any other time since the mid-1970s).](https://ritholtz.com/2021/08/how-expensive-are-houses/) 
2. If interest rates go up, stocks and real estate are going to flatline or decline.
3. The fed will raise interest rates if inflation stays above 2%.
4. The fed (and a lot of commentators and economists) believe current inflation levels are transitory.

Seems to me that everything is riding on the prediction that inflation will decline from current levels relatively quickly.  If it doesn't, the fed will raise interest rates, and real estate and equities investments will suffer.  Probably some spillover effects from that, such as reduced consumption and resulting recession."|0.75|22.0|0.0|22.0|[]

It occurred to me the other day that when people take out mortgages to buy houses, they're effectively buying into the residential real estate market on margin. So, if the S&amp;P beats the housing market (in the long term, on average), why not buy into the S&amp;P 500 through either a leveraged index fund or on margin (if you can get a good interest rate)?

On the other hand, Buffett is against this kind of strategy, but I couldn't find why. Of course, I'm advocating for a long-term buy-and-hold strategy, and not speculatively buying and selling in short terms, which is usually what people use leveraged strategies for. Perhaps my logic is flawed? If so, kindly let me know. Thank you!

**Edit: Perhaps this isn't clear in my post, but the purpose of the post is asking about the comparison of paying a mortgage to buying into the S&amp;P 500 on margin.

6 months later, all Betterment has been able to do is lose $500-600 on my $86k in this IRA, in addition to charging management fees. Seems a bit odd.

He said that it's an asset class that, until now, only the ultra-wealthy could afford. He says that, overall, it's outperformed every other asset class like stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.

He said what they do is buy paintings by established artists, form a LLC for each painting, then sell shares of that LLC to common folks like me for as little as $16K (he was willing to go as low as $8K for me to dip my toe in the water). He said it's just like real estate with comparable sales to tell us the value of each painting.

Times](https://www.latimes.com/b2b/cre/story/2021-06-15/commercial-development-and-operations-a-key-catalyst-for-u-s-economic-growth)).

So, the big question is what that shift looks like. There's the possibility of repurposing commercial space as retail and residential but that would take many years of rezoning, permits, retrofits, etc., and so some inefficiencies would arise, and the near term effect would still be a net decline in real estate value.

There will obviously also be some spaces retained for core staff, executive offices, meeting spaces, etc., but as the [WeWork fiasco](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/30/how-venture-capitalists-are-deforming-capitalism) demonstrated, the rank and file seem to be much more amenable to working from home than so-called dedicated coworking spaces.

So I came across Xenon Pharmaceuticals ($XENE) using the options screener on TDAD as a ""Highly Recommend"" covered call play and I was rinse and repeating on monthlies for a little while, then got busy with my day job and didn't sell 10/15 calls... and I opened the mobile app today to find that my underlying magically DOUBLED IN PRICE?!? I would've cried if I got assigned.

TLDR: I doubled a portion of my portfolio by accident

(there used to be a photo here but I think this sub doesn't allow them? It included the momentum graph below the candles and MA lines)

# The Actual DD: $XENE

The good news: 65mil volume on 10/04 on 41mil Shr Out after news of their cutting edge epilepsy drugs had very successful mid-stage trials, before open. XENE hopes to accelerate the FDA approval on the basis of the safety and efficacy of their medication (Source: EDGAR).

Their advantage? The mechanism for the drug allows for high efficacy while reducing the side effects that plague current medications. The current market for epilepsy medication is estimated to be around $7bil growing at about 6.6% compounded annually (Source: Coherent Market Insights).

The bad news: Epilepsy drugs are a tight market with a lot of competitors, it's hard to say how much of a market share they can enjoy this early on. There are internal discussions on how to move the drug into production and into the market but no hard plans (Source: EDGAR). These first 2 are significant risk factors in my opinion, however for short-medium term, the following section is likely the single biggest contributor to the high IV:

# The Wildcard: Shelf Prospectus

What justifies the current IV is the shelf prospectus filed during the day after the price skyrocketed before open, worth $250mil. What exactly is a shelf prospectus? Basically a way for companies to sell secondary offerings without actually filing a secondary offering. We all know how negatively secondary offerings affect share price due to dilution (See: $HEXO); even hearing the words uttered drops a share 5% instantly.

A shelf prospectus is a way for the company to better control the share price while diluting the float, by divvying up the money they want to raise and selling shares in phases. This offers three advantages:

1.	The company doesn't need to go through the lengthy process of filing with the SEC every time they want to raise funds.

2.	The company doesn't have to sell shares if they don't want to/need to.

3.	The company can play it by ear and only offer shares when the market conditions are optimal.

Now obviously, slow and steady dilution is dilution and there's no other way around that, but the decision to file a shelf prospectus indicates to me that the management of this company is somewhat capable. Fundamentally speaking, as a company you want to raise as much money as possible at the least possible expense

i.e. if you file the prospectus at a 52 week high and calculate the number of shares to be offered based on that high price, you don't need to sell as many shares for the same amount of money

i.e. less dilution of shares.

Another thing to note is their posted tangible net book value increasing \~$4 per share since June, under the assumption that the underwriters exercise the full value of the offering at the price of $31.50

Another interesting note in the shelf prospectus filed is that RBC Capital Markets is actually listed in the table of underwriters, so the fact that one of the biggest banks in Canada is backing this thing gives me a little more confidence for the long-term.

There are also small notes about lock-ups for insider shares but not enough details revealed in the SEC filings yet. IMO they are not significant enough anyway as the last known % of float owned by insiders was only around \~5%

One more major risk is that the negative effect of the dilution drops the price too low, resulting in the need of ANOTHER prospectus if they don't raise enough funds on the 1.2mil shares in this current offering (See: TMC the metals company)

# ""That was a lot of fancy words, so what are you calling?""

I'm thinking very near term bullish as this stock gains a bit of momentum, but I am hedging with medium-term puts as I do think that the medium term for the next couple years will be bearish as dilution occurs. Long term bullish so I took some profits but am still maintaining a decent (for my size portfolio) long position. After hours trading supports my near-near term views but I've seen with many pharma companies where they don't post any news for a while and the interest dies off after a couple months (See: $MVMD).

Current positions: 

•	500 shr @ cost basis of \~$15

•	5 lots Oct15 Calls SP $25

•	3 lots Jan21 Puts SP $25

The early results are positive!|"I scraped every new performance grant CEOs received in 2017 to see if copying those trades would beat the market. The initial results are very promising (12-25% ɑlpha on average depending on the timeframe), but more research needs to be done!

# How it works:

I wrote a python script that scraped every single Form 4 filed in 2017. It was only looking for filings that matched the below criteria:

1. The grant was a Performance Grant. Performance Grants are used to reward executives with stock only if they reach certain performance targets (the listing is when the targets are set, not when the targets are achieved)
2. The Performance Grant targets were for the stock to reach specified price targets. This means that the executive would receive stock ***only*** if the stock hit certain price targets during the given timeframe
3. The executive receiving the grant was a CEO or President.
4. The grant was not regularly scheduled (i.e. it wasn’t a grant they would receive every year). FIltering these out makes it more likely that the grant was given because the CEO and Board of Directors have confidence that the stock can reach the price targets.

# Overall Results

These kinds of grants don’t happen very often, there were only 9 of them in 2017, but they did indeed beat the market.

Of the 9 stocks that were found, all of them peaked at a price more than 35% above the performance grant and 6 of them peaked up more than 100% in the 3 years following the grant.

The below table is the average returns by months since the performance grant for the SPY and the stocks I found.

Taking a slightly closer look at “Max Returns” in the table below, we can see it took anywhere from 141 days to 1088 days for the stocks to reach their max return since the grant. The average was \~700 days, meaning it takes about 2 years for most of the stocks to hit their peak.

You will also see that 6 of the 9 stocks reached their performance grant targets. 2 of the 3 stocks that didn’t reach their targets had insanely high targets of 160% and 260% stock returns and both of the stocks had well over 100% returns. The other target that wasn’t reached had a 58% target but was the worst-performing stock

The stock had vesting targets at $11, $14, and $18. The stock fell about 14% over the next 2.5 months before then popping up to $10.20 (37% return) about 5 months after the grant date. The stock then had a looooong fall for the next \~1.5 years until February 6, 2020. The stock recovered and reached all the way up to $15 after COVID, but the performance grant had already expired so they never received any of the awards.

The stock price immediately started going up after the performance grant and reached a local maximum of $10.55 (85% return) 4 months after the initial grant before spending the next year and a half going down to below $7. This grant was an all-or-nothing grant where the price had to reach $16 within 2.5 years to vest. It never reached that goal but maxed out at $12.53 (120% return) about 2 years after the initial grant.

The stock crossed the $400 mark just about 6.5 months after the grant (an 85% return) before falling back down into the $200s before rebounding to the eventual high of $433 (100% return) just under 2 years after the initial grant

These grants could start paying out immediately upon hitting the $15 target and they had until the end of 2020 to hit that goal. Unlike most grants, they only gave an all-or-nothing $15 price target instead of tiered price targets that start out easier to hit. They never quite got to the $15 price target but did cross $13 (almost a 200% return) right around the 1-year mark.

It then tumbled again before reaching its overall maximum of almost $130 3 years later. Because the performance grant required at least one year to pass before reaching the target stock price would count towards the grant, the execs actually didn't start receiving the grant awards until the end of 2020 when the stock started going on a tear

This grant was only able to start paying out between the 1st and 3rd anniversary of the grant, so even though the execs hit the target price 9 months later, they didn't start getting paid out until close to the 3-year mark when they finally got above the target price again

# FAQs / Concerncs

***What is a Form 4?***

A Form 4 is filed any time an executive at a public company buys, sells, or is granted stock. They are required to file with the SEC within 3 days of taking the action

***Why did you pick 2017?***

Most performance grants have a timeline that is 3 years or shorter (though some are up to 5 years). 2017 ensures enough time has passed for the grant to actually play out

***Where did you get the data?***

The SEC has a database (EDGAR) that lets you scrape all of the info from all of the SEC filings

***Why did you pick the timeframes you chose (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months)?***

No particular rhyme or reason. I felt like these gave a pretty good overview of the short, medium, and long-term returns for each grant.

***9 stocks aren’t very many***

True. The sample size is very small. I am in the process of doing the analysis for more years to increase this number, but the number will never get very large as these types of grants don't happen super often.

**This isn't adjusted for risk in any way**

This is also true. These stocks vary from small to large market cap and have different levels of volatility which can affect the returns on a risk-adjusted basis. It may be worth diving into risk adjustments at some point, but right now I want to focus on gathering more data and seeing if there are any potentially viable investment strategies around the data.

# Takeaways

I definitely think this is promising, but the hard part is putting it into action. Obviously, if we could see the future and sell at the max price for all of the stocks, we’d all make millions, but the stocks don’t all just go up and to the right.

Some of them fall before popping, some pop and then fall, some pop then fall then pop even more.

There is potentially a viable strategy involving holding the stocks until they reach some return threshold (maybe like 25%) and then letting it run with a stop-loss, but I think I need more data to build better strategies. I will work on gathering more data."|0.93|167.0|0.0|167.0|['Compensation Committee', 'Mitek Systems', 'Heska Corporation', 'Noodles &amp', 'the Performance Option', 'Larimar Therapeutics', 'Mitek', 'SunOpta Inc.', 'G-III Apparel Group', 'Larimar', 'Heska', 'Zafgen', 'Noodles &', 'Performance Vest', 'LendingTree', 'Donna Karan', 'Wex', 'Box', 'SunOpta', 'Performance Vested']

This is a line item of 2 transactions from my history.  https://imgur.com/a/O4IMJkj

Same thing with the one above it.  0.2910*$69.22 should equal $20.14302 or $20.14.  But Vanguard has it listed as $20.13.

t3_q0xbhb|1633317839.0|investing|Stock/Funds/ETF Gains: Unrealized vs Realized vs Compound [Question]|"I am trying to better understand what are the best approaches to formulate several investment accounts that focus separately on short, medium, long, and retirement terms. The retirement I'm ok with as my 401k and Roth would operate with standard mutual fund principles. I am also fully aware of the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging.

What I'm trying to decipher in my head is understanding the link between the power of Compound Interest in combination to the above investment terms. I already understand the relation of compounding in the scope of dividends. You get the dividends and they get automatically reinvested, perfect. But my question here is related to stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. I will lay out how I understand them (ignoring the concepts of dividends altogether, so let's assume none of them disburse any dividends).

Stocks: You buy at one price. The stock goes up in price accounting for your unrealized gains. You must sell your stock (at profit) to now have realized gains. Then you have to reinvest your entire investment amount, which is initial investment + realized profit, to achieve the concept of Compounding. I just don't think this seems very reasonable for a non-professional investor, am I correct in that opinion?

Mutual Funds: You buy at the current price of the fund. The fund is actively managed and buys and sells stocks as necessary. Each time it sells a stock at profit it creates a realized gain. That gain is disbursed automatically and acts as your Compounding interest. My question is does this happen regularly or sporadically? Meaning are you actually realizing a true Compounding effect here or not really?

ETFs: They are mutual funds that act like stocks. I read some places that they will auto-reinvest any dividends they disburse but I don't know how. And since they are not actively traded then holding any ETF for the long term will not create any Compounding effect, unless you play them as stocks like stated above. Am I wrong here too?

Conclusion...Gains in the market whether stocks, funds, or ETF, are always referred to as Annualized Returns. What I'm trying to grasp my head around are whether general Gains in the market are indicative of ""Simple Interest"" or ""Compound Interest""? And being that Compound Interest is so powerful from a long term perspective, should I just stop thinking about Compounding altogether (assuming I'm not looking specifically for dividend yielding investments ATM) while I'm making these decisions? I keep running calculators seeing how an investment would grow depending on variables and of course it asks what the annual interest rate is; but some ask for compounding rate and some don't. So I don't really know which I should be looking at.

Note...I am looking to invest an initial amount of roughly $5-$20k spread over 3-4 accounts for different time frames, and injecting about $2k per month (total, not each). Just so you understand that I'm not talking amounts in the hundreds of thousands here. But being that my funds are relatively limited and I don't want to make the wrong decisions, I realized that I'm getting a bit stuck in Analysis Paralysis. So I come to you fine people. TIA

Bonus Question: Are ETF prices set by the changes in supply/demand from traders like stocks are, or are they set by the index that they track? Meaning, can the index signify that the ETF should be at $50, but investor sentiment crash the ETF down to $0, like they could with a stock? Or make it skyrocket like GME? Meaning are things like technical or price action analysis what investors use to determine the price or is the price actually linked to the underlying securities and investors just ride the wave up and down?"|0.76|25.0|0.0|25.0|[]

China as a country has been an economical miracle in this century. They literally created a prosperous middle class. They have created the world's second largest economy from third world.

According to the Hurun Global Rich List 2021, Greater China housed **the most billionaires worldwide in 2021**. By comparison, 696 billionaires resided in the United States.  [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/299513/billionaires-top-countries/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Hurun%20Global,resided%20in%20the%20United%20States)

China has emerged as the world's largest manufacturer according to the World Bank. [source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869)

Economic reforms and trade and investment liberalization have helped transform China into a major trading power. Chinese merchandise exports rose from $14 billion in 1979 to $2.5 trillion in 2018, while merchandise imports grew from $18 billion to $2.1 trillion. China's rapidly growing trade flows have made it **an increasingly important (and often the largest) trading partner** for many countries. According to China, it was **the largest trading partner for 130 countries in 2013**. [source](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html#_Toc12530869)

Today, the country is being rocked heavily. The Evergrande debt crisis is still unravelling (other major Chinese real estate companies are drowning in debt), there is shortage in many of the manufacturing items coming out of China (computer chips, precious metals etc.), they are under international pressures/(economic warfare?) from the USA and others, and now they are having energy blackouts throughout the country (?!).

The country societal problems are rearing it's head - The ruling party restricting rights, and then the one child policy is beginning to show negative economic ramifications, in that, they have too much of an aging population.

The ruling party are trying to fix all of their issues right now, with heavy debt restructuring revamping social programs. But right now it looks like China is being rocked with a lot of issues.

China is eyeing expansion of power - making ""friends"" with the Taliban (and their $ trillion mineral wealth), African presence, war with Taiwan and seizure of Hong Kong. What will be the economic ramifications of those events to China, and to the world? Yet to be seen.

Now, here is my question:

Despite the above - **China is still an economic powerhouse on the world stage**. International **Investors need China to remain as such, as China is economically intertwined**  with too many sectors in this world.

I, personally, am  still very bullish on China long term. But since it appears, that China is, honestly, under economic upheaval.

Should someone who admires China's economic performance;

Buy the dip now (while much of the equities are priced low)

or

does an intelligent assessment demand waiting until long term (1 year-ish)

orshould one just avoid China as an investment as much as possible for as long as possible (at least until the dust settles with Hong Kong and Taiwan)?"|0.72|263.0|0.0|263.0|['Taliban', 'the World Bank', 'Evergrande']

(Security Analysis book)|"I'm currently reading Security Analysis (Second edition), it mention how interests, amortization and depreciation will greatly affect the company's earning, and how by undervaluing it's assets the company can ""increase"" it's earning (because of less depreciation). However I didn't see any mention on how a bond's maturity will affect the earning. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say a company issues a 10-Y 5% $1000 bond, so each year it has to pay $50 in interests, it's gross earning is $200.   


So $200 - 50 (interests) -30 (depreciation) -10 (amortization) -20 (taxes) = $90 net earning per year, meaning that if earning doesn't increases the company won't be able to pay back it's $1000 debt upon maturity, even though the interested payments are fully covered. Shouldn't the company be setting money aside for the bond's maturity, and shouldn't that be deducted from it's earning like depreciation and amortization?  


also, what's keeping the stockowners from giving themselves a $90 dividend and giving the middle finger to the bondholders? (the company would still be paying the interests, and would not default until the 10-Y maturity, so the stockowners could milk it for 10 years)"|0.63|5.0|0.0|5.0|[]

Now that Q3 is over we have a full picture of the transactions that occurred and can (hopefully) predict the outcome of Q3 revenue. OPEN provided guidance of $1.9 - $2B for Q3. 

I used ibuyerstats.com to analyze all transactions. In Q3, I calculated an estimated 9,218 homes were removed from the website. At an average value of $345,000 per home, that would total $3.18B in revenue. However, using Q2 data from the website and press release I was able to determine that 12% of the homes removed from listing were removed for purposes other than a sale. Therefore, if you remove the 12% (assuming this stays close to consistent in Q3) I estimate revenues will land around $2.7B. Not often do you see 40% beats on revenue estimates, but this is very possible. 

Here’s to a $3.5B+ Q4 and a $15B+ FY2021.

t3_pz9qjy|1633100252.0|investing|Sharing Research on Cybin (CYBN) - A New Psychedelic Pharma Company|"Let me start out by saying that I am **NOT** a professional analyst, and that this is **NOT** investment advice. I am simply sharing the research I’ve done on this company. I own around 325 shares.

**1.** **What is Cybin?**

Cybin is a budding Toronto-based biotech company whose goal is to produce psychedelic-based therapeutic medicines for addressing various mental health issues. The psychedelic in question is Psilocybin, the active compound found in so-called “magic mushrooms”. They aim to do this through proprietary drug discovery, new drug delivery systems, and new formulation and approaches for different psychiatric disorders. For the most part, these psychiatric disorders include Major Depressive Disorder and several types of substance abuse including alcohol and nicotine. Millions around the world are afflicted by these issues, and of course that comes with a multi-billion dollar healthcare opportunity.

**2.** **Why Psilocybin?** 

Over the past few years, research has been conducted concerning psilocybin’s effect on mental health, with some promising results. Here are the recent studies that Cybin specifically cites -

[**Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 2017 – Alexander Belser et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603d2d72126ce0c8a33f0f14_Patient%20experiences.pdf)

This study bills itself as the “first qualitative study of participant experiences in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy”. It was a relatively small study with only 13 participants aged 22 to 69 with an average age of 50 years. All were affected by elevated anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis. They were provided doses of psilocybin and therapy – and the transcripts from those therapy sessions were analyzed to find common themes.

Among all or most of the subjects reported easing of their symptoms and a desire to repeat the experience of taking psilocybin. Some participants showed strong positive reactions to the treatment, such as improved relationships and catharsis of powerful emotion.

The overall conclusion of the study is that psilocybin-assisted therapy may provide an effective treatment for psychological distress in cancer patients.

Some background on the main author –

Alexander Belser holds a PhD in Counseling Psychology from New York University and was a clinical research fellow at Yale 2018-2019. He has spent a couple of decades researching the possibility of psychedelic based clinical treatment with several peer-reviewed journal articles. 2015-2017 He also served on the Board of Advisors for Compass Pathways – a well-known mental health care company. **He is the Chief Clinical Officer of Cybin as of November 2020.**

[**Elsevier Journal of Psychiatry Research, 2020 – Simon Goldberg, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/603935b9a45a717eeb9287d5_Meta-analysis%20-%20experimental%20effects%20of%20psilocybin%20on%20symptoms%20of%20anxiety%20and%20depression.pdf)

In this meta-analysis, 117 participants were studied across 4 groups; 3 with randomized-placebo controlled tests and 1 uncontrolled. All participants were clinically evaluated to be experiencing elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression. Biases attempted to be mitigated through study design included selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias.

Analysis showed an “evident” effect with statistically significant reductions in anxiety and/or depression systems based on clinical evaluation. Adverse reactions were minor and subsided within a few hours; no long term or serious adverse reactions were recorded.

The meta-analysis provided a few concessions – first that there were only four studies totaling 117 participants. There was a high risk of bias, including the fact that all participants must have been willing to take a Schedule I substance, and that three of the four studies involved cancer patients who may not otherwise be experiencing anxiety and/or depression. There was also limited diversity among subjects (58.25% Female, 86.33% White).

[**JAMA Psychiatry, 2020 – Alan Davis, et. al.**](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6022582598960827c7789b33/6039314ec645352a335785ab_Jama_Psychiatry_Davis_2020_Psilocybin_MDD.pdf)

This study sought out to study the effect of psilocybin therapy on patients with Major Depressive Disorder. It studied a pool of 27 participants aged 21 to 75 who all were afflicted by MDD and not currently using antidepressant medications. There was also a focus on cancer patients and other treatment-resistant cases of MDD. The participants were split into two groups of immediate treatment and 8-week delayed treatment.

Ultimately, the study found statistically significant improvements in the clinically evaluated MDD among the participants including half of them in remission by week 4 of the study. The study compared the efficacy of Psilocybin to Ketamine (an already prescribed drug) but with an effect lasting about twice as long (4 weeks versus 2 weeks for Ketamine). Psilocybin, like most psychedelics, also has a low likelihood of addiction (unlike Ketamine).

The study posits that this method of therapy could also be useful for treating a variety of psychiatric conditions including substance abuse disorders.

Although the science is still relatively young, Psilocybin shows positive results in a variety of studies, and has done so for a number of years. What is left is to harness the power of this drug the way we need it to be used.

**3.** **The Cybin Approach (Development Pipeline)**

Not a lot of analysis in this section, but to continue setting the stage here is Cybin’s “three-pillar” approach to drug development –

*1. Novel Drug Discovery Platform - API Modification*

Develop new APIs via selective modifications of tryptamine and phenethlyamine-based scaffolds specifically to alter their pharmacokinetics without modifying their therapeutic potential. (Changing the way drugs move through the body without reducing their effects)

Modifications involve replacing selective hydrogens with deuterium atoms.

Optimizing unique physicochemical attributes e.g. salts, crystal forms, co-crystals, etc.

Pillar One is all about discovering and creating compounds for more efficient drug design.

*2. Proprietary Drug Delivery Systems – Research and Develop*

Efficient delivery system that attempts to bypass the liver metabolism with a direct path to the brain providing faster onset (sublingual distribution).

Modified-release formulations with the potential to reduce side effects and to control exposure.

Dose control through proprietary device platform.

Delivery systems may be applied to many psychedelic compounds.

Pillar Two is all about controlling the way the isolated compound is administered, allowing for varying dosages and reliable medication times – this way patients can get the therapeutic effects of Psilocybin without feeling “high” and being potentially incapacitated for several hours.

*3. Innovative Treatment Regimen – Science Meets Technology*

Software-based platform to gather clinical research data from psychedelic treatment.

Machine learning-based data analytics for improved patient outcomes. 

Patient therapy and integration support.

Pillar Three is all about leveraging technology and data analysis to create effective drugs and treatment plans. This is where they will utilize their partnership with tech startup Kernel, who has created “Flow” – a non-invasive brain monitoring interface. Kernel Flow is like a motion-capture helmet for the head, but utilizes over 1000 sensors to monitor, image, and record precise brain activity with a rate of 200 samples per second. This data will be used to create patient-specific treatment plans.

**4.** **Achievements and In-Progress**

In this section we won’t bother to address superfluous awards or honorary mentions, but instead will focus on actual business activities.

So far they have 15 patent filings, including international patents, which cover a variety of things including novel psychedelic compounds, integration of delivery platforms, methods of use in psychiatric indications, and the drug discovery pipeline of modified and novel ergolines, tryptamines, and phenethylamines. There over 50 molecules covered by these patents.

On the drug development side, there are currently 4 active drug programs –

CYB003-005 cover three drugs who are being designed to respectively treat alcohol abuse, anxiety disorders, and the last to be used for general psychiatry and neurology. These three are still in their pre-clinical phases.

CYB001 is the flagship drug, isolated and modified psilocybin in a sublingual (under-the-tongue) film delivery used to treat Major Depressive Disorder. CYB001 is intended to begin Phase IIA trials by the end of this year, to be followed up with Phase IIB. In the clinical trial system, Phase I provides small doses to subjects and they are observed for extreme side effects or other danger. While completion of Phase I does not necessarily mean the drug is effective, it shows that in a controlled setting the drug is safe to use – and several participants still report positive effects. In Phase II, a larger group of people are split into various treatment groups with varying levels of drug dosage. Placebos are not used in Phase IIa. Phase II will verify that the drug works to some extent, will provide effective data on proper dose ranging (i.e. finding ideal minimum and maximum doses), and will also potentially reveal less-common adverse effects. So long as Phase II still indicates the drug is safe and possibly effective, the drug will move to Phase III which involves the intense scrutiny of double-blind studies, placebos, etc. and is the final phase before being released to market.

In CYB001 Phase IIa, 40 patients will evenly split into treatment groups to be given dosages in the range of 1mg, 3mg, 5mg, 7mg, and 25mg. Phase IIb will examine a group of 120 patients, 80 of which will receive a dose based on the data from IIa, and the remainder will receive a placebo. Phase II will take a total of 12 months, so a Phase III would not be expected until at least 2023, with probably 2024 being the year brought-to-market assuming everything goes well.

CYB003 and 004 are “near” human studies, but no estimated date yet. 

**5.** **Other Notes**

This write-up could really be miles long, but I definitely don’t have the discipline for that. I’m not a financials guy, so I couldn’t tell you much about how they’re doing in this startup phase of the company. So far, the company has managed to raise around C$120M.

The team at Cybin is diverse which includes: the former Ontario Health Minister, the former COO of Loblaws, Canada’s largest food and drug retailer, investment banking experience involving the execution of billions of dollars’ worth of mergers and acquisitions, experienced “new age drug” investment with previous work in cannabis startups, decades of experience in the healthcare industry, and much more.

Obviously, the biggest risk to investing in this company is that they cannot create an approved drug, or it just isn’t that effective. This however does create a large upside, and at around $2.10/share, there is potential to even have a 2x bagger just on news that they’re moving to Phase III trials. An actual drug may be able to bring 4-5x returns by around 2024-25."|0.73|22.0|0.0|22.0|['the Board of Advisors for Compass Pathways', 'Cybin', 'Elsevier Journal of Psychiatry Research', 'Kernel', 'Loblaws', 'Yale', 'New York University']

I wanted to share an analysis of why individual investors have an advantage over institutional investors and can beat the market. Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

# Introduction

Imagine you’re a new investor who just downloaded a brokerage app. Now image you’re in charge of an actively managed fund with a team of PhDs working for you. Both of these parties are planning on actively managing their portfolios by selecting individual stocks or bonds. Which one is going to generate higher returns? The answer probably seems pretty clear. If there’s any amount of inefficiency in the market worth taking advantage of it’s going to be captured by those with the most resources and the best education, right?

Wrong, which is what makes the stock market great. There are five key advantages individuals have compared to intuitional investors and passive funds.

1. *Individual investors won’t be fired after a few bad quarters*
2. *Access to information has never been greater, and is free in most cases*
3. *As an individual investor, time is on your side*
4. *Smaller account sizes provide more freedom*
5. *Individual investors can take greater risks*

We will dive into this in more detail, but first let’s look at a bit of history.

Advocates of passive index investing are quick to point out that passive funds have beaten active funds 86% of the time over the past 20 years \[1\]. Between 1991 and 1996 it was a tossup with active funds winning three years and losing three others \[2\]. That time frame was chosen so that we can have a fair comparison later on. In more recent memory, passive funds have won every year since 2013 with no signs of letting up. People quickly conclude that if actively managed funds with teams of PhDs can’t outperform a market index consistently that it must be nearly impossible for a retail investor to do so. This comparison sounds pretty logical on the surface but doesn’t look into the differences between the two groups.

**Retail investors can skip the management fees, can’t be fired for underperforming, are able to invest in a wider range of companies, and can take on as much risk as they want.**

Armed with these advantages retail investors outperformed market weighted index funds 49% of the time before fees from 1991 to 1996, almost the exact same rate as the active funds \[3\]. If you include fees that number drops to 43%. However, many modern brokerages no longer have fees to place orders. Both sides have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other. This race is a lot closer than most people think.

# Individual Investors Aren’t Fired for A few Bad Quarters

If you’re a fund manager who decides to go a little outside of the box and ends up buying a lot of stocks that aren’t part of the S&amp;P 500 you could run into an issue. Let’s say those stocks you picked ended up doing really poorly this year while the S&amp;P did fine. Managing this fund is your job. If you don’t do well you could be removed from your position. Maybe they let one bad year slide, but could you underperform your peers for two years? How about three? At some point you’re going to get fired. The retail investor could underperform for a decade and still come out on top. The market is very cyclical and some popular and reliable strategies just don’t work for years at a time. Take value investing during the last decade as an example. The market has been dominated by highly valued growth stocks. Even if you carefully selected strong value stocks you would probably not be above the S&amp;P 500 during this period. Despite this, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.54% per year since 1928 \[4\].

# Information has Been Democratized – Institutions are Still Paying

When you have a team of PhDs working for you to help select your stocks you have to pay them. You also need to pay yourself, pay for the office, and for any other resources you use during the selection process. These costs are going to be passed onto the investors of the fund in the form of management fees.

***These fees often cost between 0.5% and 1% annually \[5\].***

This piece is taken each year whether the fund does well or not. This means that even if the retail investor and the fund held the exact same stocks the retail investor would come out ahead.

# Time is on Your Side

Any active fund is going to be extra aware of their quarterly and annual goals. They’re going to be frequently rebalancing to meet certain requirements whether it be a risk level, an amount of diversification, or a reevaluation of their pick’s financials \[6\].

A retail investor can hold a single stock for 40 years if they believe in the long term future of the business. Let’s say both the retail investor and the fund bought Apple at the same time 20 years ago. Apple has grown an insane amount during this time frame. As one stock outpaces the rest it starts to take up a larger and larger portion of your portfolio.

The fund would likely end up selling some of their shares to bring the size of their Apple holding back in line with the rest. This also lowers their exposure to the tech sector which they would also want to keep at a certain level. The retail investor on the other hand has no such limit. He can buy it and hold it until he retires.

# Size Matters But Individual Investors Can Use it Wisely

The average retail investor is buying thousands of dollars of stock at most. The average fund is buying hundreds of thousands of dollars and often millions. This is important for a few reasons. Thousands of dollars will not have any effect on the price of most stocks whereas a million dollars can move a sizeable company. The more money being invested the more it can push the price. When you are buying tons of shares the price is going to creep upwards as you look for more and more sellers. This means that the more you buy the worse your average entry price will be. The same thing happens when you sell. Unloading millions of dollars in shares is going to drop the price which means you get a poor exit price as well. The retail trader does not have to deal with this and will have better prices on both ends which leads to better performance, even if the same stocks are picked!

The size of the investment doesn’t only affect the prices you get, it also influences what you can even attempt to buy in the first place. Some publicly traded companies have market caps of 50 million or less. It’s just not feasible for huge funds to be buying into these companies. If a fund ever buys so much of a company that it owns 5% it will need to register that with the SEC and is forced to file beneficial own reports \[7\]. The retail trader will never run into this issue.

# Individual Investors Can Use Risk to Their Advantage

We’ve seen a few reasons why funds tend to stick the S&amp;P 500 companies. We’ve also seen that they are surprisingly risk averse. Whether it be buying smaller companies, having a more concentrated portfolio, or making use of derivatives like long term call options, the retail investor has the ability to take on as much risk as they want.

If you’re familiar with the statistics behind optimized betting you’ll know what the Kelly Criterion is. In short, it’s a way to determine the optimal size bet you should take\*\*.\*\*

**The Kelly Criterion says that you should be holding a little more than 200% in the S&amp;P 500 for maximum returns, at least historically \[8\].**

This is a heavily leveraged and high risk account but was able to survive both the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis. Despite higher returns in the long term this portfolio underperforms the market for years after each crash. This makes it unrealistic for a fund manager to try to execute, but if you can handle the risk it’s an option available to every retail investor who has a long time horizon.

# Final Thoughts: If Managed Properly, These Advantages Allow Individual Investors to Beat the Market

It’s true that most actively managed funds do not outperform their passive counterparts. This is often used to cast doubt on the performance of retail investors. If the experts can’t outperform, how could you? Well, it turns out there are a lot of differences between billion dollar funds and some guy on his Robinhood app. A surprising amount of these differences offer the retail investor an advantage, or at the very least an additional degree of freedom. Using actively managed funds as a benchmark is incredibly misleading.

The odds are not in your favor as an average stock picking retail investor, but they’re not nearly as bad as they’re usually portrayed\*\*.\*\*

**In the same 1991-1996 study 25% of retail investors outperformed the index by 6% or more annually.**

If you dedicate the time and have good emotional control you can capitalize on these advantages most people don’t even know they have.

\----

TLDR; The individual investors has a number of advantages over institutional investors and can beat the market

t3_pxsq91|1632912146.0|investing|Should you invest in the most reputable brands in the world? - Benchmarking performance of the worlds most reputable brands against S&amp;P500|"Coke is just soda.

Levi’s are just jeans.

The iPhone is just a phone.

Yet, we go out of our ways to select certain brands over others - most of the time at a higher price \[1\]. Everyone knows the importance of reputation for a company. Highly reputable brands have multiple things going for them:

* Their customers are extremely loyal and drive recurring purchases
* The public is vocal about recommending their brand and products
* Easier to expand to other markets as their reputation precedes them

Basically, you can consider having a great reputation to be a positive feedback loop on steroids! In an economy where 70-80% of the market value of a company comes from intangible assets like brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill \[2\], reputations can make or break a company’s performance.

In one of my previous analyses, we had discovered and proved that the [best companies to work for routinely beat the market in stock returns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/). So this week, let’s see how the most reputed brands have performed over the last decade!
___
**Data**

While there are multiple companies that measure reputation, I chose the [RepTrack](https://www.reptrak.com/) list for my analysis as they seem to be the most established ones and have been creating their top 100 list for the last 2 decades.

They base their study on more than 240K responders over 15+ countries and the rating tells us how the companies are regarded by the general public. They have multiple factors that go into the final ranking, but for this analysis, I am only considering the final rank of the company.

I am considering the companies that were present in the Top 10 list at least once in the last decade \[2012 - 2021\] 
___
**Analysis**

RepTrack publishes their result in March, every year. Since I could not find any fixed date of publication, for the purpose of the stock price calculation, I am using April 1st of every year as my investment date.

Even though the company produces a Top 100 list, I have limited my analysis to the Top 10 companies \[3\]. We then calculate the stock returns generated by these companies \[4\] over various time periods (1-year, 3-years, 5-years &amp; till date) and then compare it to our benchmark. \[5\]
___
 **Results** 

**Return Comparison - SPY vs Top 10 - Most Reputable Brands** 

|Time Period|Most Reputable Brand (Avg Return)|SPY (Avg Return)|Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Year|17.1%|16.2%|0.9%|
|3 Years|44.8%|41.2%|3.6%|
|5 Years|94.1%|77.9%|16.2%|
|Till Date|188.3%|136.4%|51.9%|

 

Companies in the most reputable list have consistently beaten SPY over different time periods. There is a significant improvement in overall return when holding the investment for a longer-term.

My hypothesis here is that, even though the short-term returns can be affected by market cycles, over the long run, companies having a great reputation end up outperforming their peers, and this is reflected in their stock price.

[Another interesting insight](https://preview.redd.it/shv1yw10q8q71.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b85dbf0596b22f9d93bfa3f1cd954f012e9e796) we can derive from the data is the performance of the top-10 companies in each year’s list. As we can see, the most reputable brands beat SPY by a considerable margin in 7/10 years \[6\]. 
___
**Limitations to the Analysis**

There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

* Ideally, the backtest should be done over 30-40 year’s worth of data as we would know how the changing trends would impact the analysis. The last decade or so was predominantly biased towards tech.
* One should also benchmark this against the companies having an average or poor reputation to see if reputation is indeed a distinguishing factor that is driving the returns. \[7\]
* Finally, reputation is just one factor related to the company. There are companies whose reputations are in the gutter but have produced extraordinary returns for their shareholders (Facebook gave 175% return &amp; Volkswagen gave 117% return in the last 5 years even after all the scandals they have been through). 
___
**Conclusion**

Whether you like it or not, brands seem to have a significant impact on our daily lives. Just think about the number of times you/your friend have sworn by a brand and recommended it to everyone \[8\]. Almost all the brands in the top 10 list (eg. Rolex, Ferrari, Adidas, Harley-Davidson) have users that are extremely loyal, willing to pay a premium, and acts as unofficial spokespersons for the company.

Our analysis, in turn, proves that all these positive factors cause the company to outperform the market! So now you know what to do next time when your friend is swearing by a brand.

Until next week…

**Footnotes and Existing Research**

\[1\] [This great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIDBV4Mpek&amp;ab_channel=BigThink) by Big Think showcases how Apple and Nike have spent billions of dollars for creating a positive brand image in our brains and most of us, in the end, are not rational customers.

\[2\] [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks) \- Harvard Business Review

\[3\] The main reason for stopping with the Top 10 is the manual data pull process. They do not give a stock ticker associated with the stock nor is the list easily parsable. Given we are pulling data for 10 years, I limited myself to the top 10 companies.

\[4\] A stock is only considered if it’s directly investable from the US market and is an independent company (Examples of companies ignored - Rolex, LEGO Group, and Bosch)

\[5\] Before you come at me with Pitchforks for using S&amp;P 500 instead of Nasdaq Composite, please take a look at the list of companies. It’s from a wide variety of industries. Adding to this, even though tech provided the majority of returns, starting in 2012, you would not have any idea about the tech run we would be having over the next decade.

\[6\] I don’t think 2020 and 2021 should be counted here due to two reasons. First, it’s not enough time as we can see from the first graph (there is very little difference in performance over 1 year period), and secondly, 2020 was one of the largest bull runs in the history of SPY.

\[7\] [This report](https://www.rankingthebrands.com/PDF/Global%20RepTrak%20100%20Report%202016,%20Reputation%20Institute.pdf) by RepTrack shows the impact the Emission Scandal had on Volkswagen

We are experiencing the most inflation in over 30 years right now and gold is not budging. In fact, gold is approaching pre-pandemic prices. Furthermore, real interest rates, which are interest rates that take inflation into account, are among the lowest they've been in 50 years. They were lower only in the mid-70s and early-80s. When real rates are significantly below zero for an extended period of time, gold usually rises. However, gold is not rising and maybe it is because it is a) not fashionable and b) no longer suitable for this era.

However, if inflation persists gold could still rebound. In the event of continued or above trend inflation, investor's will feel a need to find a store of value. Large institutional investors have a duty to preserve their clients' investments. They will buy anything that holds value, even if it doesn't rise much. Gold could be a logical pick because it is somewhat easy to buy and has a long track record.

Could gold still be that store of value?"|0.86|438.0|0.0|438.0|[]

**What is Copy Trading?**

For those who haven't seen it before, there's several brokerage platforms out there where you can elect to automatically copy any trades done by a certain person. In some versions, the person being copied receives direct fees from the person following them. In others, the person receives no fees but instead will be ""compensated"" by people rushing into the trade after them. This raises big questions around the fiduciary responsibility of the trader being copied to the followers -- a legal gray area that keeps a lot of the major stock brokerage platforms away. 

It's more popular in forex and crypto but there have been several recent articles about companies trying to bring this to equities.  On one hand, it's really interesting because it's the democratization of who can gain a following by making great investing calls, leveling the playing field for niche investors who are experts in one domain but lack access to a network / capital to launch a traditional fund. Additionally, this already happens in some less organized ways with people mimicking famous investors styles, like Warren Buffet.  On the other hand, it's ripe for abuse and a lot of people can be swayed by seemingly large performance that was just random luck.

**Discussion**

I anticipate that regulatory hurdles around this stuff will stay in place and likely prevent major firms from launching fully automated copytrading platforms for a while in stocks but I've also heard opposite takes that this will dismantle funds as we know them.

When a security consolidates at a high, the odds are that it will break out and reach higher highs. 

[Russell chart](https://ibb.co/pvzvQM4)

Who actually sees any additional upside exceeding its March '21 ATH? The Fed's timeline is already set: It is scheduled to begin tapering asset purchases and raising benchmark interest rates beginning as early as mid '22, early '23. 

Is the Russell going to trade within this range or break out to new highs until then? It's likely going to remain rangebound. 

The charade of supporting markets at the expense of everything else will continue as long as possible. The probability the Fed delays these plans is quite high, since it’s predicated on maximum employment and stable prices (symetric 2% inflation), and we are a long way from maximum employment. (Inflation is another story.) 

On a side note, the Russell has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past 18 months."|0.87|460.0|0.0|460.0|[]
t3_pwvway|1632793845.0|investing|The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us|"I don't expect this to be super popular but I want to make it as a record to say I called it. 

The good times are almost up. 

Here's a long wall of text, don't apologise for it, no TLDR. Don't expect anyone to read this anyway.

--- **Everything depends on treasury bonds and inflation** ---

Don't look at the S&amp;P as a PE ratio, but as a yield, so it's 1:1 with bonds. For example the S&amp;P 500 has a 34.75 PE - in earnings yield 2.9% a year. The ratio between treasuries and the S&amp;P 500 is called BEER (bond equity earnings yield ratio). 

Currently a 10 year US treasury yields 1.4% and S&amp;P 2.9%. The yield on a treasury can't exceed stocks in the long run, who would buy stocks if they could do better in risk free bonds. S&amp;P comes with risk premium due to downturns. 

Treasury yield are near all-time lows due to a number of factors including COVID and the fed printing $120b/month to buy securities. Low treasury yields make S&amp;P look more attractive, driving up the price and down the yield. 2.9% is better then 1.4%.

This relationship between treasuries, inflation and stock yields determines *everything.*

Money supply has expanded rapidly due to massive printing. M1 massively, M2 slightly so far. As the velocity of money increases with reopening it guarantees M2 expansion.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL

Wages are up, commodity prices are up which in conjunction with massive money printing *guarantees* inflation will at the very least run hotter then it was pre-2020 for an extended period of time. How hot... who knows? In 2019 it was 1.8%, so at a minimum we're looking at 2%, probably higher. Not hyper-inflation but hotter then before. This is a certainty. 

--- **The debt burden** ---

The government funds itself with treasuries and so the yield it has to pay is a major deal. The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that's $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that's $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable. 

This massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed *cannot* allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America. 

Given a choice between crashing the market and inflation it will crash the market. It does not have the option to do anything else, it cannot let yields rise significantly. 

--- **So what does this mean for stocks?** ---

Remember: Inflation rate &lt; Treasury yields &lt; S&amp;P yields

PE ratios going up over last 30 years is not the result of investors randomly deciding stocks are worth more. It's the result of low inflation, therefore low treasury yields, therefore low S&amp;P yields, therefore PE going up, therefore stocks going up. 

The US economy in real terms has been barely growing, a couple percent a year at best, the massive bull run over the last decade is not a sign of economic prosperity, it's almost purely multiple expansion. We're at one end of the pendulum and now it has to swing back.  

Inflation guaranteed to go up = treasury yields guaranteed to go up = S&amp;P yield guaranteed to go up (PE ratio going down). 

The yield on a treasury can't trail inflation significantly and historically has sat above inflation. There are less buyers for something guaranteed to lose purchasing power every year. 

That means if inflation sits at 2.5% we're looking at treasury yields at a minimum of 3-4%. Which means S&amp;P yield (currently 2.9%) has to sit up around 5-6%. This would involve the S&amp;P losing *half* its value from relatively small absolute changes to inflation. 

Even the fed estimates inflation to be 4% in 2021 and 2% going forward which will be the absolute best case scenario. 2% inflation would still cause at least a 20% drop in stocks, probably much more.

--- **Conclusion** ---

Inflation running hotter is a mathematic certainty. Treasury yields going up is a mathematic certainty. S&amp;P PE ratio (and therefore stock price) coming down is a mathematic certainty. 

The fed can choose to either fight inflation and crash the market, or let inflation run free and support the market. It will mostly choose the former, however we will see a bit of both. Inflation will run hotter then expected and stocks will fall.

The market won't crash all at once bar some unforeseeable event, this won't happen overnight, it will gradually wheeze down as treasury yields adjust to the asset purchase taper and inflation ticking up. I am naming the upcoming event **""The Great Wheeze""** and I expect everybody to call it this.

The underlying economy will keep ticking along relatively normal as before, so barely growing in real terms, but stocks will spend years in decline as treasury yields rise. People will recommend 60/40 stock/bond portfolios again. If you are looking to work in investment banks ask to join the bond division. 

I predict this will start within 12 months, probably accelerate early-mid next year and continue. 

--- **Is there a way to make money from this?** ---

The problem with everything bubbles is there's less opportunity. Almost everyone is going to take a hit.

Diversify away from US stocks, invest in low PE foreign markets with high underlying growth to counteract PE compression. Economies that aren't to dependant on exporting to the US is best. We're at the cusp of a new era in investment that will be defined by international markets. Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.

The other option is to hedge with 20-40% of your portfolio. Hedge against treasury yields going up (hello Burry) and the market going down. Goofy valuation stocks will fall the most. The problem is the market can stay irrational for extended periods of time.

Holding cash is ok, but inflation will start to eat into its purchasing power. There's not going to be a sudden dip and then rebound, it will wheeze out for years, as it's not caused by some temporary recoverable event like COVID or the GFC, it's caused by the economic equivalent of gravity.  

The other option is markets don't collapse in uniform. Typically there's a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core. If you're holding stocks pre-collapse, selling them and buying in sectors that have already collapsed is another play.

Caterpillar and Home Depot - already performing nicely since pandemic and before, less likely to lose market share to companies like Amazon or other online retailers over the next 5-10 years, infrastructure bill may have some impact, low interest rates = people spend more money on upgrades around the house and towns/cities spend more money on roads

Chewy - been getting hammered the last month or so, not a had spot to add some considering they have a strong business model and seem to be well positioned for any future covid scare scenarios or even just a strong reopening of the economy, win win imo

Intel - how is this not undervalued ? I understand Amd and Nvda have taken some market share for themselves and the deal with Apple ended last year, aside from this I believe the company is solid and should not be trading anywhere near the p/e it currently is 

Dell - seems like a solid move with the 5 bil buyback taking place, technicals are strong 

Mrk - Merck and Co seems a bit undervalued and the technicals are showing buy, nice dividend, slow mover but nice for the long term

Yeti Holdings - liking the breakdown we are seeing and I will be waiting for the right time to add this one, love their products, low p/e, nice strong trend, what is not to like ???? Maybe they should merge with crox and run together!!!! 

AbbVie - I like the weekly chart coming back down to the 50 ma for a buy, looks like a big cup and handle forming, adding this along with AZN 

Docusign - any dips I'm buying 

Afrm - swinging for new highs, technicals are strong, looking for a breakout very soon 

Amd - still holding strong 

Dkng - love it long term, adding dips whenever possible 

Netflix - loaded months ago, up nicely and holding

Tesla - not selling, new highs coming

If I were to take this approach my ideal portfolio if going by past history would be 30% schg (vug), 25% schd, 45% tlt rebalanced roughly every quarter. From Jan. 2012 the cagr is 12.5% vs the 16.3% of the sp500. The drawdown however is -6% of the 3 fund portfolio vs the -19.6% of the sp500.

t3_pv5wbq|1632573172.0|investing|Comparing LSI and DCA: is the Vanguard paper still right?|"Sorry for the deliberately provocative title, I could not resist. 

I felt like wasting some time, so I decided to download the November 1978--July 2021 data about the [MSCI World Index](https://backtest.curvo.eu/market-index/msci-world) and compare the performance of Lump Sum Investing versus doing Dollar Cost Averaging over 12 months. 

As you all probably know, [a famous Vanguard paper](https://static.twentyoverten.com/5980d16bbfb1c93238ad9c24/rJpQmY8o7/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-Just-Means-Taking-Risk-Later-Vanguard.pdf) did about the same, using a much greater amount of data (United States market 1926-2011, United Kingdom market 1976-2011, Australian market 1984--2011) and concluded, that, on average, LSI outperformed 12-month DCA (in terms of the ending portfolio value after 10 years) by 2.3%, 2.2% and 1.3% respectively. 

Aside from verifying the results of people way more expert than me and wasting my own time, my purpose here was to consider two questions: 

1. Did the relative performance of LSI/DCA change in recent times? Is there any particular reason to think that ""this time it is different""? 
2. Sometimes people suggest that DCA might be preferable to LSI because ""the market is very high"" or because ""there has been a lot of volatility"". Do these arguments make any sense? (I was pretty sure that the answer was no, for reasons I will explain in a moment, but people often say that so I might as well check that out. In the unlikely event that some criterion along these lines worked, obviously I wouldn't even think about posting this here before double-checking it on new data for one year or two and then exploiting it for a while to make ridiculous amounts of money, so if this has been published sometime around late September 2021 you already know the answers). 

### A hopefully unnecessary warning 

I am writing this partly for my personal amusement and partly to see if anyone here finds something wrong with my analysis or some obvious error (there might well be!). If you base your financial decisions on the advice of some random redditor... well, I would like to strongly advise you not to do that, but that would lead to an interesting paradox.

Still, if you decide to do/not do something -- anything -- because of what I write here and it turns out that it was a terrible mistake that's not my fault, alright? 

### Why LSI should usually beat DCA, and why I don't think you can predict much more

Very briefly, if you do DCA over 12 months, investing 1/12 of what you have every months, you are buying your shares at (an approximation of) the *average* price they'll have over the next 12 months rather than at the current price. Thus, 

* If the average price over the next 12 months is higher than the current price, which it should usually be as long as the market mostly goes up in the long term, then LSI will be more convenient than DCA, and if it is lower (which should not happen as often) DCA will be more convenient instead; 
* If there existed some simple criterion (like volatility or the market being ""high"") that could let you predict whether DCA might be more convenient than LSI, the same criterion could let you predict if the market will mostly increase or mostly decrease over the next year. If this existed, professional investing firms would likely be aware of it already and would use it for buying shares when the market is likely to rise/sell them when it is likely to fall, thus making that very criterion obsolete at once. 

Still, arguments are one thing, data is another. Let's have a look anyway. 

### Methods

For this analysis, I will ignore issues related to fractional shares and fees. 

* To compute the performance of LSI, I will do the following: I will assume I bought $1000 worth of shares at a certain time and I will look at their value after 12 months. That's it. 

* To compute the performance of DCA, I will assume I bought $1000 worth of shares every month, for 12 months, then I will compute the total value of my shares after 12 months. Then I will divide this value by 12, so that I can compare my investment of $12000 with the $1000 LSI investment. 

Differently from the Vanguard paper, I will compare the LSI/DCA investments immediately after these 12 months instead of looking at their values after ten years from the beginning of the investment. The reason for this is that, after 12 months, all shares that could be bought have been bought one way or another and the relative performance of LSI and DCA will not change. Also, unfortunately I could not find the full data about the values of the MSCI World Index during the 2021-2031 decade, which I would need to do that. If anyone has access to that data, I would be *very* interested in having a look. 

The two criteria I will consider and see if they have any effect on whether LSI is better or worse than DCA are 

1. Is the market ""high""? To estimate this, I will look at the current price divided by the average price over the last 12 months. If this rate is much higher than 1, the market has ""risen rapidly""; if it is much smaller than 1, the market has ""fallen rapidly"". 

2. Has the market been volatile lately? For this I will use the normalized standard deviation over the last 12 months -- that is, the standard deviation of the price over the last twelve months divided by the average price over the last twelve months. Using the non-normalized standard deviation would be a mistake here: the market is much higher than it once was, and a 1% fluctuation today would be far greater than a 1% fluctuation twenty years ago. 

In order to evaluate LSI and DCA, I need at least 11 months of data after the current month, and in order to compute the above parameters I need at least 11 months of past data. Therefore, I will be able to compare LSI and DCA with respect to these parameters only over the Oct 1979-Aug 2020 period.

### Some numbers and pretty graphs 

The average return of LSI was $1113.67, with standard deviation 180.86; 
The average return of DCA was $1055.71, with standard deviation 97.32. 
On average, the difference between LSI return and DCA return was $57.96 over the initial $1000 investment, and LSI beat DCA by 4.9% (in the sense that, on average, the return of LSI was 104.9% of that of DCA, *not* that the return of DCA was 95.1% of that of LSI - I state the obvious, but that's not the same thing).

The 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles for LSI and DCA returns are ($771.67, $1013.49, $1127.49, $1234.04, $1395.76) and ($861.83, $1004.16, $1063.83, $1121.20, $1207.23) respectively. 

These results are roughly in line with those of the Vanguard paper, if a perhaps little more favorable to LSI, and confirm what should intuitively be true: investing via DCA in general is less advantageous, but it is ""safer"" in the sense that it leads to somewhat more consistent outcomes. Whether that is worth it, of course, is up to personal preference. 

Let us now visualize what investing $1000 using LSI/DCA would have gained (or lost) us during this period: 

[LSI versus DCA.](https://imgur.com/MPHAVJV)

One thing that I think is noteworthy here is that, in recent years, the relative performance of LSI and DCA appears to have been fairly typical. Sometimes it is argued that the market is now behaving in a very different way in which it was behaving in the past, and this may well be correct; but insofar as comparing the performance of LSI and DCA is concerned, the recent times do not appear to have been particularly unusual.

Another thing that is clearly visible from this graph (and that was pretty predictable) is that the performances of LSI and DCA are highly correlated: when LSI does well, DCA usually also does (but not as well), and when LSI does badly, DCA also does badly (but not as badly). 

Let's throw a quick linear regression (not the fanciest approach, I know, but there seems to be no need to get fancy here) to confirm this: 

[LSI vs DCA: linear regression.](https://imgur.com/4Xe1Hwt)

The correlation coefficient is 0.9, expectedly high. 

At this point, one might wonder why this graph and the linear regression suggest that, generally, DCA will gain/lose you about half than what LSI would, when we computed before that over our data LSI beat DCA by 4.9%. The answer to this is that in this graph we are looking at gains/losses, not at total returns: if, after investing $1000, you'd get $1100 if using LSI and $1050 using DCA, you'd have gained half as much using DCA as using LSI, but LSI would have beat DCA by 4.8% ((1100 - 1050)/1050 = 0.048). Also, linear regression attempts to find the linear function that minimizes *quadratic* error, which is also an issue when making this type of comparison (this means that linear regression tends to weigh outliers more - there are ways around it, but I don't see the point of overcomplicating our approach here). 

Still, the overall message of this image is clear: over the considered data, investing via a 12-months DCA usually led to profits/losses about half as big (both in positive and in negative) than investing via LSI. Will it be the same in the future? I don't know! Perhaps! Perhaps not! The correlation seems pretty solid; but all of this is descriptive, not predictive. 

And on the topic of prediction, let us see our cherished parameters -- that describe if the market has been ""high"" or ""volatile"" lately -- are of any use for deciding if DCA is better than LSI or vice versa:

[Advantage of LSI vs DCA when market has been ""high"" or ""low"" recently](https://imgur.com/JrJ0weV)

Yeah, not seeing much of a correlation here - in fact, this graph is a pretty clear violation of the [Randall Munroe regression test](https://xkcd.com/1725/). 

What I think is interesting, however, is that the ratio between the current price and the previous 12-months average is not *that* high in recent data (the yellow dots) compared to other times in the past: in fact, it seems pretty typical. If I made no mistakes, this would seem to suggest that ""the market has risen too quickly, so you should do DCA instead of LSI / you should wait to invest""-style arguments are not only incorrect in that the conclusion does not follow from the premise, but also in that the premise itself is false: the market has been rising lately, yes, but it has not been rising unusually quickly. 

Let's throw a linear regression anyway, just to see what happens:

[LSI vs DCA when market is high - regression](https://imgur.com/Nfob924)

For the record, this is the linear regression algorithm throwing up its hands and going ""What? No, you silly person, no"". 

Let's see if ""volatility"" -- as measured by normalized standard deviation -- fares any better as a predictor of LSI/DCA performance: 

[LSI vs DCA: looking at normalized standard deviation](https://imgur.com/TbZgReL)

Yeah, no. As a criterion on whether in the next 12 months the market will on the average go ""up"" or ""down"", i.e., whether it would be better to do LSI or DCA, past normalized standard deviation is useless. Perhaps less expected than this is that, it would appear (if I have not made mistakes somewhere, which might well be the case), the market has not been particularly volatile lately - quite the opposite, if anything!  

### Some conclusions

Is it better to use LSI or DCA? This is up to the individual investor, I think. Neither choice seems inherently unreasonable: with DCA, you will probably reduce the impact on future profits, if they happen, and losses, if they happen. If you are investing to begin with, you likely think that there is a decent probability that the price will go up; and if this is true, then by using DCA you will effectively pay part of your potential profits (in the past, about half or a little less) in exchange for diminishing the potential losses in case you are wrong (again, by about half if the past is any indication, which might or might not be the case). Also, DCA has psychological advantages that are not to be ignored - if going lump sum and seeing the value of your investment fluctuate wildly from month to month would make you miserable and worried, you might well decide that you are willing to ""leave money on the table"" for the sake of your own mental well-being. 

What *is* unreasonable, however, is to try to use criteria such as ""has the market been rising very quickly lately?"" or ""has the market been fluctuating a lot?"" to decide whether DCA would be preferable to LSI or vice versa. The are simple reasons why these should not be useful indicators, and a quick-and-dirty experimental test seems to confirm this.

Also, there is often the feeling that lately the market has been ""going crazy"" or behaving in ways very different from what it used to be like. This might be true in some respects, but it does not seem to be true in all respects: in particular, the market has not been fluctuating more than it used to, and it has not been rising faster than it used to in proportion to its current prices (this can also be confirmed by looking at a log-scale plot of the evolution of the prices), and the relative advantage of LSI compared to DCA seems not to have been changing either. 

So, this is it. I'm curious if someone here has comments or criticisms about this analysis (I repeat myself, there could easily be mistakes here!) I can also share the code somehow, if people are interested, but honestly it is nothing sophisticated (if you can do a little scripting, you can probably replicate it in maybe half an hour or so) and it could be more interesting to try to  replicate/falsify my tentative conclusions independently. 

Anyway, thanks for taking the time for this monster post!"|0.82|43.0|0.0|43.0|['LSI', 'DCA', 'Vanguard']

I've been gathering data provided by my brokers api. I've used it to calculate things like weekly performance. Everything was working fine using the market value of a position between two dates to calculate the percentage increase. What I didn't think of was, that the calculation would not work correctly anymore if I bought more shares. I can't figure out how to properly calculate the percentage increase in this case and could use some help.

Here are two data points of a position. Essentially one is from the week start and the week end. I've increased my postion in the middle of the week.

    ""mktValue"": 2212.11,
    ""avgCost"": 8.65110205,
    ""avgPrice"": 8.65110205,

Then a simple cheap and amazing trade is to simply buy PUTS on any / all your favorite over valued, overhyped not profitable SaaS or other stock to Dec or Jan. 

Examples; DDOG currently $150 PS over 50X. March price mid $80’s.  $110 Dec PUT 24% out of the money goes for $120 (in the money over $1.3K) Notice I didn’t even look for puts in the $80’s or $90’s. You can run this exercise over and over SNOW, DASH, SPT, ASNA, MNDY, S, NET, ZS the list is honestly endless.  

“Oh there is no way any of these stocks will drop that much”. REALLY???? Are you sure?  None of them are profitable and trade and insane multiples.  And higher rates = venom to high multiple / valuation stocks.  Proof? Recent Proof? Just look at the relation of real rates and the collapse in price of all of these stocks.   On average if rates go up 100bspany stock trading at 25X Price / Sales will suffer a 20-30% multiple contraction. 

Just look at the CAPM formula.  

 ERi = Rf + B (ERm - Rf) 

-Rf = Risk Free (AKA RATES THE HIGHER THIS KEY # IS THE MORE YOUR MULTIPLE WILL CONTRACT)

-ER= Expected Return 

-B = Beta of the investment / stock 

-ERm = Expected Return Market 


And for the ones who don’t know this is the standard formula which provides a simple and important metric “Capital Asset Pricing Model”.

t3_pu971x|1632446031.0|investing|Letter 005: Biotech Buckets|"September 24th, 2021

To Those Who Wish to Learn,

*“If you don’t know what you want, you will probably never get it.”* \- Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes

Everyone sees biotech investing as largely risky, and it is, [but that is not why you are here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nFNJSIaR7c). There are a million ways for you to lose money, and only a few for you to make money. With that being said at the root of biotechs, there are essentially 5 categories - New Frontier, Platform, Copycat, Spinoffs, and Behemoths with varying potential investment returns.

**New Frontier:**

These biotechs typically are studying something no one else is, both advancing the science, and choosing a target that has been passed over by many other companies. This type of company will either do very well, or very very very (did I say very?) poorly.

These are personally my favorite category to invest in, because 1 winner will make up for all your less than well-to-do investments.

**Pros of New Frontier:**

* When it hits, it hits, these are potentially 10x+ baggers
* Depending on direction of the company, may not even need to be commercially viable and be suitable for a buyout
* Market exclusivity for a few years
* For oncology indications - combination data typically even better than solo data, so can become standard of care - chance to become behemoth

**Cons of New Frontier:**

* These companies typically only have one agent, when you miss trial results, then there is typically a data desert (not [dessert](https://youtu.be/Hhj9B2hymBw?t=48)) this means you either - exit, hold for a long time and hope for turnaround, or the company goes bankrupt in the meantime
* While these companies can be well-funded, not always, so ATM stock offerings are more common = diluted shares = bad news
* Inherently risky, no comparison because Mechanism of Action is unique. Need to evaluate runway, potential indications, and potential outcomes
* Drug dosing issues
* New Safety Signals (bad side effects popping up in studies)
* Lack of efficacy found
* Different does NOT always mean better
* Think of something bad that could happen - this is where it goes
* No similar company positive trial moments
* Copycats will come for you, and are getting quicker and quicker
* If runway long enough, the company can learn from 

**Examples of New Frontier:**

* Cortexyme $CRTX - Going after a completely different target for Neurodegenerative Disease - Gingipain Inhibitor, while most Alzheimer's Disease targets amyloid plaques (which have so-so results). The trial readout is in under 2 months and this will likely go bust, but I can’t help but root for the underdog who goes after a completely different target - probably [my biggest bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV-XT27UOHo).
* Karyopharm $KPTI- Agent focuses on Nuclear Export Inhibition, completely different than 
* Oncolytics - $ONCY- Unique Oncolytic Virus - without special handling requirements, injected IV, and potentially systemic benefits, upcoming trial readout.
* Pharmacyclics $PCYC - BTK inhibitor, incredible run before being bought out.

**Platform:**

These companies are becoming increasingly popular with VCs. A telltale sign of a platform company is that they have multiple agents, but with similar backbone or “technology.” Some companies try to brag about their new technology, when it really isn’t that unique, so buyer beware.

Usually there is more data to support these types of companies and platforms than New Frontier. It’s been in academia, or there is a proof-of-concept out there. As we get better and better at identifying drug targets via basic science these companies will become - more common, and more successful.

This used to be more of a strict thing - like a company will go all out with monoclonal antibodies (Genentech), but now it may be a platform with complementary agents (immuno-oncology for example), or conjugate type. The definition has become looser over time.

**Pros of Platform:**

* Really only need to either really hit on one agent, or do pretty good on two agents in order to be bought out
* Usually better funded, and increasingly popular with VC
* Multiple Shots at success
* Multiple trials going concurrently in the beginning, so less of a data desert
* If you have multiple success, then you become profitable and eventually becoming a large cap
* Potentially better C-suite, this can vary, but if you have experience, and performed before, you can typically get a safer position, and if you have had success, VC are much more likely to throw money at you
* Combination with in-house agents = money printing machine

**Cons of Platform:**

* When a safety signal comes up, it’s a concern, when the same safety concern pops up in two trials it’s usually dead
* Many, but not all, of these companies in 2021 are targeting the same targets that many other companies already have FDA approved indications in. While it is possible to make better agents, the commercialization is very difficult without a direct head to head study, which comes with it’s own risks.
* Not always, but sometimes market cap is inflated due to “potential” which can be hard to live up to

**Examples of Platform**:

* [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline) $MRNA - mRNA platform was quickly applied to COVID-19, currently booster for Delta and Beta is being tested, as well as flu vaccines
* [Jounce](https://jouncetx.com/our-pipeline/) $JNCE - Trying for multiple agents in Immuno-Oncology space
* [Denali](https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/pipeline) $DNLI - Strongly VC backed company looking mainly at Neurodegenerative Diseases (ND)
* [Gingko Bioworks](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/our-platform/) $DNA - Strongly VC backed company 
* [Bicycle Therapeutics](https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/programs/#bicycle-conjugates) $BCYC - Immuno-oncology and “bicycle” conjugate focused company

**Copycat:**

These companies will focus on the same target as many other companies, it is possible that it is developed in silo, however you’ll notice once one company starts to have success, many other companies join in. One of the current greatest threats to the American biotech industry are domestic and [foreign companies](https://www.beigene.com/science-and-product-portfolio/pipeline) making similar agents then offering at much lower cost. There are some companies that are trying to [address this](https://www.eqrx.com/progress-and-pipeline/), but it will become a greater and greater threat over the next two decades, and this could potentially undermine the rewards that typically balance out the risks that people take. Imagine you take all of the risks and costs of developing an agent, find a suitable target, etc, then another company develops a similar agent without the risks involved. While it is a good return for them, it removes incentive for innovation over time.

**Pros of Copycat:**

* If you have a target that another company has positive study results in, it typically results in a stock increase (Example [$CRVS](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4456580-corvus-surging-on-astrazeneca-cd73-success-with-key-data-readout-looming-crvs) and [$SURF](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3740955-surface-oncology-climbs-as-astrazeneca-cancer-trial-data-highlights-cd73-effect) from this past week popping 25% because of an [$AZN trial](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/imfinzi-combined-with-novel-immunotherapies-improved-clinical-outcomes-for-patients-with-unresectable-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer.html), guess they’re [simpatico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX8sddUj1uA))
* Typically strong basic science to back up target mechanism of action, maybe even clinical trials
* Can improve upon agent, especially if small molecule, by learning side effect and receptor profile
* Space is more “developed” meaning that your goals and targets are set
* FDA more likely to give approval if similar agent is already available without strong safety signals
* Again head-to-head studies cut both ways, but if you can prove superiority to established standard of care you can get market capitalization

**Cons of Copycat:**

* Space gets crowded quickly (see PD-L1s and PARP Inhibitors) with usually a first movers advantage
* Commercialization becomes much more difficult, especially as Big Pharma moves into a space, their rounding errors are your entire sales budget 
* This is more of an observation - but employees who go to a copycat are typically less motivated to change the world, they’re there for a paycheck. If you have your “why” then you don’t want to spend years of your life not advancing science

**Examples of Copycat:**

Since CD73 has been in the news thanks to Astrazeneca this week

* [Astrazeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-therapy-areas/pipeline.html) $AZN - Oleclumab
* [Corvus](https://www.corvuspharma.com/our-science/our-pipeline/) $CRVS - Mupadolimab
* [BMS](https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/in-the-pipeline.html) $BMY - BMS-986179
* [Novartis](https://www.surfaceoncology.com/pipeline/the-srf373-nzv930-program/) $NVS - NZV930 (formerly SRF 373)
* [Incyte](https://investor.incyte.com/press-releases/press-releases/2021/Incyte-Announces-Data-from-Multiple-Programs-Within-its-Oncology-Portfolio-Accepted-for-Presentation-at-the-AACR-Annual-Meeting-2021/default.aspx) $INCY - INCA00186
* And many more, but you get the idea

**Spinoffs:**

There can be many reasons for a company to do a spinoff, and it largely depends on the size of the company. In the worse case it is because they think the main company will fail, but the spinoff may be profitable. Another reason is that the new company is extremely high risk, and they don’t want a failure on their hands or from their bottom line, so they raise money via multiple ways (VC, SPAC, etc). 

**Pros of Spinoffs:**

* May have valuable assets and a headstart on what would otherwise be a new venture
* Infrastructure likely to be in place - familiar executives and workers, with an appropriate headcount
* Doesn’t have the baggage of the original company

**Cons of Spinoffs:**

* There is a reason it was a spinoff, meaning that if it was a slam dunk, they would have kept it, unless the original company had issues (typically financial) or worries about it’s success
* Usually accurately or higher priced, because market is known, as a result harder to find value

**Examples of Spinoffs:**

* BlueBird Bio $BLUE - [spinning off 2seventy bio](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/bluebird-names-oncology-spinoff-establishes-leadership-team) focusing on oncology
* Illumina $ILMN - [spinning off GRAIL](https://investor.illumina.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Illumina-Acquires-GRAIL-to-Accelerate-Patient-Access-to-Life-Saving-Multi-Cancer-Early-Detection-Test/default.aspx), then buying back at an inflated price

**Behemoths:**

These are the biotechs that have made it, are highly profitable, and usually have at least 3 commercially available agents, yet are still “small” enough to be acquired. These companies are large enough to buy other smaller biotechs as well. From an internal organizational standpoint there is greater depth and specialty, which pays dividends, employees don’t typically wear “many hats” like at other biotechs.

**Pros of Behemoths:**

* Runway is not an issue, it’s profitable typically, so a negative study, is less likely to strongly affect stock price
* The company typically can produce a second generation agent that is improved over first generation
* The company can expand the research budget which fuels greater growth. Instead of one Phase 3 trial, can have 4-5 concurrently
* If the company is highly specialized in an area, they have a competitive advantage with their employee knowledge
* Companies develop a great reputation which makes it easier to attract top talent, and improves everything

**Cons of Behemoths:**

* These companies typically are highly valued, so the stock, compared to other biotechs, is less volatile. 
* Big Pharma buyouts are getting larger, but not at multiples of what the stock price is typically, however the buyout price is slowly increasing due to Big Pharma’s Pipeline Issues
* More likely for stock price to be accurate, as these are established companies, so harder to find value

**Examples of Behemoths:**

* Alexion $ALXN - Acquired for [$39BN by AstraZeneca in 2021](https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/acquisition-of-alexion-completed.html)
* Allergan $AGN - Acquired for [$63BN by Abbvie $ABBV in 2020](https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/abbvie-completes-transformative-acquisition-allergan.htm)
* Celgene $CELG - Acquired for [$74BN by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2019](https://news.bms.com/news/corporate-financial/2019/Bristol-Myers-Squibb-Completes-Acquisition-of-Celgene-Creating-a-Leading-Biopharma-Company/default.aspx)

Quick q from a trading perspective. 

If you have one security that is listed and trade on different exchanges, i.e. has a London line / Australian line, or London line / ADR, etc... when fx'ing the share prices to a common currency, we'd expect them to trade in line with one another (law of one price, else arbitrage).

If the securities prices have been trading a siginificant spread over time - what would you attribute this to? Valuation of the sum of parts in the London book vs Aussie line being justified through their P/E? etc.

V curious to get others take on it, as my analysis attributes it to a valuation of the statements held in the region of the listing potentially explaining the differential. I wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything else!

Bond trade associations have written to regulators to say amended rules will have a “significant, deleterious effect” on government and corporate bond markets, and pleaded for an explicit reprieve, or more time to comply. The amendments were first proposed last year, but market participants assumed until recent months that the rules would continue to pertain to the stock market alone.

“We believe that such an application of the rule is overbroad and unnecessary”, wrote the Bond Dealers of America and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

The SEC’s 1971 statute, known as ‘rule 15c2-11’, governs the “publication or submission” of prices to buy and sell securities away from exchanges. Market participants have largely considered it an attempt to guard retail investors from predatory schemes and fraudulent activity in penny stocks. 

The rule requires broker dealers such as JPMorgan Chase and Citi to check a wide range of information on issuers, including quarterly and annual reports. Last year the SEC, then led by Jay Clayton, tweaked the rules for the first time in almost three decades, and included a requirement for the information to be publicly available.

“These retail investor-focused improvements to Rule 15c2-11 are long overdue,” said Clayton at the time, adding that advances in technology meant investors could be privy to more up-to-date information before trading.

The statute has never explicitly excluded bonds but, in practice, it has never applied to them in its 50-year existence. This has long suited a market where many corporate issuers are not listed on stock markets and do not routinely produce regular earnings reports. It is unclear what disclosures would be required for government bonds, such as those issued by the US Treasury.

But Michael Decker, vice-president of policy and research at BDA, said the SEC, led by new chief Gary Gensler, has confirmed the rules will also affect government and corporate bonds under the amendments outlined last year. Only municipal securities have an explicit exemption. 

“Here we are a matter of days away and very little work has been done. It is pretty clear to me that the SEC hasn’t really thought this through,” said Decker.

The SEC declined to comment. 

Rising awareness of the new requirements has sown confusion in the bond market as bankers, trading platforms and investors now face intense compliance demands ahead of an unforeseen month-end deadline. 

The concern is that without guidance or amendment from the SEC, trading in part of the bond market will cease when the rule comes into force at the end of this month, as broker dealers back away for fear of attracting an enforcement action from securities regulators. 

The SEC’s move comes at a time of increasing regulatory scrutiny of fixed income trading, with Gensler noting this month that he intends to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the market. 

Broker dealers are scrambling to understand how to gather, review and publish information on the companies whose bonds they trade. They are also questioning what counts as publication or submission of a quote on a bond — terms left undefined in the rule.

Bond trading has increasingly transitioned to trading on electronic venues, with prices streamed on screens. In an attempt to avoid publishing quotes, some market participants could shift trading back to phones until clearer guidance is available. 

“The risk is that if the broker dealers feel they can’t be in compliance based on the interpretation of their internal teams then they might be forced to stop quoting certain bonds to ensure they aren’t out of compliance,” said Kevin McPartland, head of research, market structure and technology at Greenwich Associates."|0.88|73.0|0.0|73.0|['the US Treasury', 'BDA', 'the Bond Dealers of America', 'Greenwich Associates', 'the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Citi']
t3_ptjv00|1632357846.0|investing|Ford partners with battery recycling and materials startup Redwood Materials amid EV push|"Ford Motor has tapped Redwood Materials to create a closed loop system for its upcoming deluge of electric vehicles — a partnership that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials.

The deal comes as Ford adds more electric vehicles to its portfolio, including the Mustang Mach E that launched last year and the upcoming[ F-150 Lightning pickup truck](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/). Securing a supply of batteries — or the materials to make them — has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.

Ford alone will require a hefty supply. The company’s global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030, according to the automaker. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.

“Closing the loop for us in our end-of-life products and allowing those to re-enter the supply chain will help us drive down costs,” Lisa Drake, Ford’s chief operating officer in North America, said during a press briefing. “Of course, it’ll help us reduce the reliance on importing a lot of the materials that we use today when we build the batteries. And then it’ll reduce the mining of raw materials, which is going to be incredibly important in the future as we start to scale on this space.”

All of this, Drake says, will made EVs cheaper and more sustainable.

Redwood Materials recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. The company, which was founded and is led by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, says it can recover, on average, more than 95% of the elements like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.

Redwood then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC’s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses. Redwood’s first automotive partnership was secured earlier this year with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra.

“The risk is that we find ourselves in a situation perhaps a little bit similar to current global semiconductor shortage if we don’t plan ahead, and if we aren’t strategic about the production capacity and the right regions at the right time,” Straubel said during the briefing.  

Under the partnership announced Wednesday, Redwood Materials will initially work with Ford to set up recycling within the automaker’s battery production network and then funnel the recovered raw materials back to the manufacturer to be used in batteries. While Ford didn’t provide specific details, that likely means working with its battery cell supplier SK.

In May, Ford and SK signed an initial agreement to create a joint venture — to be called BlueOvalSK — to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade.

The ultimate aim of the Redwood Materials-Ford partnership is to touch the entire battery lifecycle from recycling production scrap and supplying Ford with materials to creating recycling options for the end-of-life vehicles. That last piece is complex because Ford will no longer own its EVs, many of which will have multiple owners before they’re ready for the scrap heap.

The deal follows a string of announcements in recent months by Redwood Materials. The company recently raised more than $775 million — a round that TechCrunch learned includes $50 million from Ford. (The company initially announced the round was [more than $700 million](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/).)

It also revealed in September plans to [expand its business](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/) beyond battery recycling and into the production of critical battery materials at a new million-square-foot factory in the United States. Redwood wants to produce cathodes and anode foils, the building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure.

The factory, for which the company is currently scouting a location, would likely be dedicated to the production of cathodes. Redwood has said it intends for the factory to ramp up to 100 gigawatt hours of capacity to produce cathode material, enough for one million electric vehicles by 2025.

I thought to myself the other day about “apex” companies. These are the companies that are far and away the leading companies in their space.

For example:
Social Media:
Facebook
Online Shopping (and cloud..):
Amazon
Search: Google
Smartphones: Apple
EV cars: Tesla

You get the idea. But what I was moderately surprised at was the **lack of social media** **marketing** company. When a company is scheduling things to advertise on Instagram, responding to your whining on Twitter, or answering customer queries via Whatsapp, what are they using? **If you’re a top company, they’re using Sprinklr.**

Go look for yourself. What’s Amazon’s Twitter using? What’s Google’s Twitter using? What’s ESPN (Disney) using?

Other examples of companies that use Sprinklr (as of Q2):
Netflix
Microsoft
Twitter
Amazon

Google
The Marines (yep, it’s been government-certified)TSA
Accenture
Deloitte
McDonalds

If you work at a big company, you’ll recognize there are a lot of disparate tools being used in a similar function. Social Media management is no different. At its simplest, Sprinklr allows companies to organize content across platforms, easily respond to customers through different channels, and analyze the outcomes. This is exceedingly valuable to companies in order to manage their social media (helping with marketing efficiency, customer service outcomes, social listening, etc.)

There are also much deeper integrations here as well, but we will start with that. Now, how much do you think a company would be worth, given that the majority of the Fortune 100 uses their services? What if I told you they had 74+ customers generating over $1M each on a yearly basis? What if I said they had about 1000 other customers, with average subscription revenue (yearly) of $350K each?

Well, whatever you had in your head - the current market cap of Sprinklr is roughly $4.3BN. By EoY, they’re expecting (their prediction from Q2 earnings) to generate \~$415M in revenue (22% growth YoY).

However, I believe it’s generally undervalued for a variety of reasons.

1. They are recognizing revenue from subscriptions (90% of their revenue) as it happens, not when the deals are signed. I believe their estimates to be really low. Consider that there are 74 customers with at least $1M in yearly subscription revenue, and they themselves have stated they have 1000 customers with an average yearly value of $350K (as of June 23).Well, if you just took the average value X 1000 customers, + $74M, you’re already at $424M revenue. And no doubt, there are more customers signed since June, and no doubt some of the 74 “big” customers are spending much more than $1M annually. They also have the opportunity to upsell their current customers. **TL;DR** they’re clearly going to be way ahead of their projected earnings and will continually revise earnings skyward.

2. This is a really sticky industry. The companies that put the amount of work to migrate to use Sprinklr aren’t going to change to a different provider easily (and frankly, a single competitor doesn’t really exist). Retention is likely to be extremely high.
3. Sprinklr is **really early**. The fact that they have the majority of the biggest companies on the planet signed bodes well for their future. They have now stated they’re targeting the next biggest 30000 companies, and their sales pipeline/staff has started to ramp up (paused all of last year). I would expect many more companies to be signed here; additionally, I expect additional products to be released that can be upsold to existing customers (live chat analysis, liter-research platforms - they just announced something like this called Modern Research Lite - etc.)

Anyway, I could say a lot more, but by this point I either have your interest or not. A few things to conclude with -

1. Look at companies in an adjacent space to them. Qualtrics (survey + experience management company) - $23BN. Zendesk (mainly customer support/comms) - $14.5BN. Liveperson (a stock that literally just does chat on a website) - $4.7BN. Take any comp you want - probably undervalued.

2. Sprinklr does have a competitor called **Sprout Social**. Sprout is awesome too, and much more targeted at small companies. I’m invested in Sprout as well; they’ve been on a rocketship recently ($7.3BN cap with $132M in yearly rev). However, I like Sprinklr over Sprout for a variety of reasons.. But the main one? **Trust what the top companies on Earth are using**. And I will take their judgment on this one. There’s probably room for both to succeed, but Sprout is much more narrow in my mind.

3. All wall street analyst PTs are above current price, with the lowest at $21 and the highest at $29.

4. There is basically **zero** ETF ownership of this, which is absurd as Sprout has **60** ETFS that contain it. I would be shocked if ETFs didn’t start picking this up, which will likely lead to a quick upswing in price because the amount of outstanding shares is quite low (high amount of institutional shares held, but can’t be sold).
   1. This has led to volatility recently (5-7% up and down days), but it doesn’t seem to be reflected in options pricing as IV is \~60-70%.


Risks:

1) The platform is new and potentially difficult to use (which will scare smaller orgs). I see this a lot with tech platforms where they have a lot of products, but they're hard to use. Sprout is much easier to use, for example.

2) Salesforce could vastly improve their spot in this space, either an acquistion or dedicating lots of $$ to a similar product. Their product right now, however, is not good.

3) Upselling is currently not good for existing customers. They will need to continue to upsell to existing customers in order to improve their average sub value. 

4) Very dependent on large customers. This is their entire strategy, working from the biggest down. However, this puts more risk that any given large subscription could migrate from the platform, which would cause outsized revenue loss (however, most of these contracts are 3-5 years, and again, I think the moving cost is so high that most companies will not do so).

5) There's a lot of diffracted solutions for a pure social media management play - Sprout, Hootsuite, etc. It's possible companies decide this is what they really want, and they don't want the extras and solutions management that Sprinklr offers.

6) Two different funds own a substantial amount of the float (~30-40%), and while they are known for holding longer term (fastest sell from IPO was ~2 years with Coupa), it does present a potential risk.

Financials:
I mentioned this a bit earlier, but fleshing it out to fit subreddit rules.
Current market cap: 4.3BN
2020 annual revenue: 386.9M (up 19.32% YoY)
P/S of about 10. Competitors ratio: XM (~21), ZEN (~12), LPSN (~20), SPT (~55).
Projected 2021 annual revenue: 415M
Cash on hand: 579M (up ~9X YoY; bolstered by IPO)
Expected operating loss of $64M (reinvesting revenue into business and ramping up).
Strong enough balance sheet with over 12 months of burn rate available on hand.


TL;DR Sprinklr is undervalued. Massive opportunity. I think it could be the “Salesforce of Social Media Management”. Position = 2600 shares and 38 Feb 20 calls.

* Are the current supply chain problems transitory or structural?

Key weights on inflation:

* Debt
* Demographics
* Digitalization

Post-GFC is the advent of the mini-cycle.  Spreads are shorter duration than pre-GFC.  Mini-cycles are a global phenomenon.

**Tom Davis, Portfolio Manager and MD – Jennison &amp; Assoc.**

Key observations:

* Innovative/disruptive business is advantaged on large, addressable markets and regional markets.
* Top quintile earnings growth is a strong predictor of total return in the stock.

Secular trends to focus on:

* Direct-to-consumer.
* Digitalization - will grow $5T in next ten years.
* Electric Mobility - Norway is the only country with significant adoption thus far.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ramona Persaud,  Global Equity Income &amp; Dividend Growth Lead Portfolio Mgr. - Fidelity**

Key fund criteria contributing to the Risk-Adjusted Total Return:

* Excess investment return.
* Downside protection.
* Reasonable income.

Buying good companies with wide moats at excellent prices increases odds of excess return.

Key observations:

* US is discounting the pandemic more than non-US.
* EM opps strong but very capital intensive; can tick off excess return but not downside protection &amp; income.
* China: Macro is hard to predict, too many variables. Wait for great valuations.
* Overall: Valuation spread collapsing; balanced portfolios prevail for now -BUT-
* Smaller, boring companies that gush cash are where to focus when valuation spread widens.

**Lukas Smart, ESG Portfolio Manager and Dominic Maister, Head of Due Diligence - Blackrock**

Key observations:

* $50-$100T in cash flow movement in the transition to low carbon over next 30 years.
* 72% of Americans interested in sustainable investment."|0.78|28.0|0.0|28.0|['Harvard Kennedy School', 'Onramp Invest', 'Oakmark Funds', 'Electric Mobility', 'DWS', 'non-', 'GMO', 'Morningstar', 'Saez &amp', 'MFS Investment Management', 'PIMCO', 'Morgan Stanley Investment Management', 'Counterpoint Global']

1. For years I've been thinking about REITs vs Rental Properties.

Fact is: I hate managing tenants and taking out a loan in my country is not that optimal (I have cash anyway). For this reason I am leaning towards REITs but I know so little about them, I don't know where to begin.

Do you think REITs better in my situation? Any opinion helps.

2) No big investor has more than a few percent invested in REITs (Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, Lynn Alden etc.).

So if REITs are so good, why don't investors buy more REITs?

On the flip side, investors who are real estate oriented have 50%+ of their portfolios in physical real estate.

Why is there no big investor with a portfolio that is at least 50% REITs?

Is there something I'm missing?

t3_psr4fx|1632255634.0|investing|Why is no one talking about the Credit Default SWAPs tied to Evergrande's USD 300 Billion Debt|"A credit default swap is "" a financial contract whereby a buyer of corporate or sovereign debt in the form of bonds attempts to eliminate possible loss arising from default by the issuer of the bonds. This is achieved by the issuer of the bonds insuring the buyer’s potential losses as part of the agreement. ""

Essentially, it is insurance for the creditor in the case of default from a debtor.

A creditor can get into these credit default swaps contracts, where a creditor pays a fixed amount to another party (the insurer) and when/if the debtor to the creditor defaults  the insurer will step in to make the creditor whole.

Now, people have known about Evergrande and their liquidity issues for about a year. Investors (Debtors) would have purchased these credit default swap contracts for Evergrande.

Now, apparently this week is full of holidays for China - so TOMORROW, when a good chunk of China is back to work AND when China is expected make an announcement as to whether or not they will SAVE Evergrande or let it default, THEN we  will find out how the markets truly respond to this catastrophe.

**What would be the effect of the credit default swaps on the rest of the financial markets?** Obviously, we don't know who the insurers are, but I'd imagine that that insurer is probably issuing securities out of its pooled credit default payments. Like all insurance companies.FYI, Credit Default Swaps are what really hurt AIG during the 2008 housing crisis.

Side note: Everyone is expecting China to step in and save Evergrande or somehow at least prevent contagion effects throughout the chinese markets.

I am looking to make my first real investments in the stock market, I am doing some research into sectors that I feel might benefit in the long term.

My area of competency is technology, my theory is that most governments are moving towards Net-Zero emissions in the next few years forcing the sale of Electric Vehicles. I don’t think the price of batteries will come down all too much as historically there has been minimal improvement in the space - although I do support this innovation I think cars will be expensive for next few decades.

This leads me to believe that most consumers will finance a vehicle rather than selling it, and this seems to be a popular option even in today’s market.

I am trying to find companies that lend money primarily for the purpose of a car loan but searching through google just leads me to endless advertisements. I am really struggling to find good information about how the business model actually works.

Can anyone shed some light on this subject? Do car makers deal with the financial services themselves? Do people go to banks for this or are there a list of companies I can compare to gauge the historic performance of this model to see if it is the right investment for me?

I know time in the market is more important than timing the market overall. And I am doing that overall. But I wasn't there for the ride up, so I am somewhat conflicted.

What do you guys think and are we heading down a bit? Since I waited so long already missing out on all the gains, might it not make sense to wait a little more and actually go in at a lower point, to not end up going in only at highs?

# Overview

Cepton provides state-of-the-art, intelligent, lidar-based solutions for a range of markets such as automotive (ADAS/AV), smart cities, smart spaces, and smart industrial applications. Cepton’s patented MMT®-based lidar technology enables reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solutions that deliver long range, high resolution 3D perception for smart applications.

  

From the very start, Cepton has focused on the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) market. As disclosed in the S-4 filing, Cepton has the largest known lidar production award - GM selected Cepton as their lidar supplier for upcoming 2023-2027 cars featuring UltraCruise functionality.  Cepton has designed a suite of lidars exceptionally attractive to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like GM, Ford, and all other top 10 OEMs by being:

 - automotive grade
 - small form factor &amp; best-in-class performance
 - ultra competitive price (tech advantage)
 - partnership with tier 1 supplier (mass production)

  

Founded in April 2016 and led by industry veterans with over two decades of collective experience across a wide range of advanced lidar and imaging technologies, Cepton is focused on the mass market commercialization of high performance, high quality lidar solutions. Cepton is headquartered in San Jose, California, USA, with a presence in Germany, Canada, Japan and India, to serve a fast-growing global customer base.

  

Cepton is going public via a SPAC merger ticker **GCAC.** A [press statement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/05/2275660/0/en/Cepton-Technologies-Inc-an-Innovator-in-Automotive-ADAS-Lidar-and-Growth-Capital-Acquisition-Corp-Enter-into-Business-Combination-Agreement.html) released on August 5th, 2021 suggests that the merger is ""expected to close in the Q4 2021"". The S-4 was filed September 8th, 2021, and is available [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001498233/000121390021047072/fs42021_growthcapital.htm#T29).

# Market Opportunity
Cepton is focused on the (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) ADAS market, which is already a thing, and is expected to grow significantly in the next 10 years. This slide is taken from the investor presentation showcasing the [market opportunity](https://i.imgur.com/UvLVZ4d.png)  
  
&gt; Increasing awareness about vehicle safety ratings and decreasing component costs due to extensive application of cameras and radars will be major growth drivers for the ADAS market. Major OEMs are embracing ADAS solutions to achieve higher safety ratings to attract more consumers. Hence, leading OEMs either standardize safety systems across the models or offer them as additional features. Thus, the increasing penetration of ADAS features will surge the demand for components such as cameras, radar sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and LiDAR during the forecast period.

# Competition

  

Innoviz, Microvision, Velodyne, Aeva, Ouster, Aeye, Luminar

  

Cepton has a huge leg up on its competitors by having the largest production award (GM) as well as partnership with a key tier 1 supplier (Koito). According to both Cepton's investor presentation and S-4 filing, these things take considerable time (2+ years) &amp; have incredible competition (at least 30 lidars considered for GM production award). No other lidar company expects deployment on a significant number of vehicle models (especially non-luxury) anytime in the near future.

  

Microvision (MVIS) has completed their **prototype** lidar in April 2021. Cepton finished their prototype in 2017, and is currently fine tuning the mass production process. Futhermore, Microvision recently claimed that they would win the markets by being cheap and selling their lidars for an AVERAGE of less than $1000. Cepton lidars are &lt; $500 with the Nova lidar being &lt; $100. Needless to say, Cepton is not concerned with competition from Microvision at the moment.

  

Another interesting fact I noticed: many Velodyne and Innoviz leaders have left and decided to join Cepton.

  

# SPAC Transaction Overview

  

-   Transaction reflects a ~$1.5Bn value for Cepton

As of writing this, GCAC is trading at $9.89, below the theoretical floor of $10 for SPACs.

  
  
  

# Bear Cases 

  

The merger falls apart. This seems quite unlikely as both Cepton and GCAC have experienced leadership &amp; backgrounds. 

  

Cepton's deal with GM falls through. While again this is theoretically possible, the chances seem very small based on the investor presentation &amp; S-4 filing. Cepton had been in talks with GM for years before the announcement, and GM went through an extensive selection process of over 40 other lidar companies. Furthermore, Cepton is already partnered and supported by Koito, a Tier 1 supplier already approved and supplying parts for GM vehicles. 

  

The AV market is a bust. Cepton is currently focused on mass-market Lidar serving ADAS, which is a very real &amp; growing market. While it is true that currently the lidar market is pretty saturated, there is definitely an addressable market for ADAS in vehicles in the next 5 years. Cepton's ability to actually land the largest known Lidar production deal is nothing to scoff at.

# Conclusion

  

Cepton has strong fundamentals, landed impressive deals and partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout leader in the lidar market. ADAS (safety &amp; assist) is not as sexy as AV (self driving), but there is a clear market for it TODAY, and Cepton has already taken the first step with the landmark deal to supply lidar for multiple GM cars.

  

As of writing this post, GCAC is trading at $9.89, and is a relatively low-risk investment as SPAC's typically have a $10 floor due to the ability to redeem the stock at closing of the merger for $10.

While the lidar &amp; SPAC markets are not so hot at the moment, I still see Cepton as undervalued at the moment, and the situation as a great low-downside investment opportunity. If Cepton succeeds with its engagements with all top 10 OEM's, then this current price would be one hell of a steal. 

  
  
  

**Game plan**  

I bought &amp; plan to hold shares for several years. 

You can also just play the merger - buy now, then hold until the merger date &amp; decide then whether to keep or sell.
  
- Buy shares, GCAC will change to CPTN after the merger. Shares will be 1:1
- Warrants, GCACW, if you're not familiar how warrants work they are essentially call options with a fixed strike price of $11.50
- Options trading - buying calls &amp; selling puts

  
  

**TL;DR:** 

Cepton quietly landed massive deals &amp; partnerships, and is positioned to be a breakout lidar company. Currently GCAC is trading at &lt;$10, which is usually the floor for SPACs. This seems like a fairly low-risk low-downside investment, with great upsides at the moment since awareness of Cepton is so low.

t3_ps3b7k|1632170372.0|investing|Had an interesting test today for my “all-weather” portfolio|"I have over $1 million in my IRA,  100% invested in VTSAX. I won’t touch this nest egg for at least another 10-15 years and maybe longer. This is truly my buy-and-hold account.

So obviously, today’s market drop doesn’t concern me in the least.

I have another $10,000 in a taxable account that I use for fun things: beer money, casino trips, video game purchases, spa treatments, etc.

This is money I am not investing for the long term. I will spend this down between now and retiring. I am more interested in capital preservation.

For this reason I invested this money in an “all-weather” portfolio, an idea pioneered by [billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/) and popularized in [Tony Robbins’ book “Money: Master the Game](https://fourminutebooks.com/money-master-the-game-summary/).”

This portfolio is designed to make money in most any market and rarely ever lose money.

Here is how I have invested this $10,000:

* 30% Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
* 40% iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT)
* 15% iShares 7 – 10 Year Treasury ETF (IEF)
* 7.5% SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD)
* 7.5% PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC)

So far this portfolio has performed fine and I have been happy with the performance. 

I have not had a chance to see the all-weather portfolio put to the test…until today.

As I saw red everywhere today I opened up my Robinhood app with curiosity to check my balance.

I have no idea how my IRA did today and honestly don’t want to look but my all-weather portfolio was actually UP today by 0.02%.

I recommend this portfolio for short-term goals (savings for a house down payment, for example) or as a hedge against sequence of returns risk. If it’s money you don’t want to risk losing this might be worth checking out."|0.87|384.0|0.0|384.0|['VTSAX', 'Robinhood']
t3_prw7it|1632148733.0|investing|China’s growing property crisis: a look onto a few spill over scenarios|"**Further conclusions (ADDED sep 22)..**

* Chinese indexes opened on Wednesday and didn't show panic. Media coverage in China shows that Evergrande news are secondary or even tertiary (possibly sidelined) to avoid stark main streets reactions 

* Onshore (local) bond payments of Evergrande have been resolved through negotiations off the clearing house, which a implies delayed payment schedule. (this is saying bond is paid on Sep 23, without payment actually happening on Sep 23)
 
* According to bond covenants (bond agreement terms) Evergrande may have 30 days to pay its unpaid or partially paid bond interests/coupons if not completely paid on the agreed date without facing penalties ... hence the unfolding of the crisis due to unpaid onshore and offshore bond obligations may take months, which provides the Chinese gov with ample time to inject liquidity, trim &amp; restructure the Evergrande empire as well as externalise toxic assets. Thus containment is likely, bits and pieces may resurface in 202 when more data about China based land and property sales is available, steering further market sentiment in positive or negative direction.

* Possibly most of the upcoming gov &amp; authorities' involvement will happen behind curtains, so we won't learn much about the evolution of this drama in the news.

* markets in US, EU and Asia will likely calm down short-term until big quarterly data dumps show the impact on China market sentiment, incl. Caixin Manuf. PMI, Services PMI and Commodity Index


Assumptions…

* 70% of wealth in China is held in property (elsewhere average is btw. 20 to 35%)

* Evergrande’s international payment obligations are due on Thursday

* 1/3 of current China GDP is created by construction and property related activity (builders, materials/commodities, industrials/machines, services, etc) 

* China property market (sales) has been lagging for some months already

* a lot of Chinese investors have been harmed by the gov's regulatory actions in respect to Chinese tech companies (declining tech stocks), hence sentiment sensibility is heightened

* holidays in China until wednesday .. markets are closed... thus delayed reaction of Chinese main street

* Evergrande's total assets approx. 2trillion RMB (2% of China’s GDP) and complex structure (+200 offshore &amp; almost 2000 onshore wholly and non-wholly owned subsidiaries). Accounts for roughly 4% of China’s total property sales. Its over 123,000 employees and 3.8 million contractors make up a fraction of China’s over 400 million urban labor force.

* 40% of mainland China based bank loans are backed by properties


Further Information

* Insightful article (English) from China's leading business magazine Caixin (China's version of WSJ/FT) about the internal dealings (various schemes &amp; crowdsourcing debts)  of Evergrande    https://archive.is/8QjU6  
* based on the article there could be a large volume of hidden debts and other obligations off their balance sheet
* it will likely take years longer to complete the portfolio of 800 building projects under construction, because of unpaid contractors and due to Evergrande having to pay other obligations first
* in respect to the complexity of Evergrande's assets, holdings, financial products and corporate constructs, it may take the Chinese gov months to accomplish at least the minimum of insight into the breadth of the longterm financial obligations
* UBS estimates that $19 billion of Evergrande’s liabilities are made up of outstanding offshore bonds.
* in the case of bankrupt developer Yinyi Group (approx. July 2019) the process from application to restructuring kickoff took 2 years (Dec 11, 2020 signed reorganization Investment Agreement), yet it seems to have partially failed because investors didn't come up with the required funds (Link Bloomberg Law: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/yinyis-investor-fails-to-wire-required-funds-for-restructuring) (2nd payment up until July apparently was also much lower than agreed by courts).... these things take long in China and are very intransparent, yet they may suffice as means of containment



Market impact

* after digging into surrounding circumstances many analysts (jeffries, JPM, MS, citi, UBS, Barclay, Fidelity) believe that systemic distress is not evident, risks are priced in and that contagion can be avoided  ([Bloomberg!] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/wall-street-s-message-on-evergrande-china-has-it-under-control)

* we may see more market tremors once Chinese markets are open (wednesday), so Tuesday may be green in US and Europe in the verge of slight rebounds

* a large net injection may signal Beijing’s intent to reduce systemic stress. If the Peoples Bank of China withdraws funds, that could mean it’s prepared to tolerate higher market volatility as the developer moves closer to a default.



Outlines of 3x spill over scenarios 
----------------------------
**1.) Unorderly containment + large spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to other property and real estate firms in China.. with unorderly containment, leading to a considerable decline in many related industries (incl. services) due to panic and liquidity-squeeze-related market actions. Property prices in China would collapse and lead to a moderately sized property sell-off -&gt; the rather significant negative GDP impact would hit Chinese wallets directly, leading to severe repercussions for China-focused firms (global) and China’s future growth in general

-&gt; large impact on international markets (most sectors), global crisis potential, quicker decline of China’s GDP, FED would have to delay tapering 


**2.) Orderly containment - moderate spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to other property firms in China.. with orderly containment, resulting in a moderate decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the GDP decline would impact China’s domestic spending/consumption power moderately and lead to a medium-long term cooling of the China property market with rather big slow down of international commodity markets (spec. looking at Australia, New Zealand, South Africa)

-&gt; moderate impact on international markets (few sectors only), less long-term effects, slow-paced decline of China’s core GDP


**3.) Orderly containment - small spill over**

Evergrande default spills over to a few selected property firms in China (with extra large debts). China’s gov steps in quickly and aggressively to ensure an orderly containment with a direct relief to calm down markets, resulting in a small decline in a few related industries (construction, concrete/steel, machines, real-estate) -&gt; the slight GDP decline would result in rather short-term consequences for China’s domestic spending/consumption power. The CCP would at least manage to keep China's property prices stable thus not affecting savings/wealth of the main street too significantly; the spill over effects would be barely visible.

-&gt; only short-term / slight impact on international markets (selected sectors only)

The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water.

\[Source\]([https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/2002/06/reducing-water-usage-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/2002/06/reducing-water-usage-in-semiconductor-manufacturing/))

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

📷

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out much in dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

For some of you, it might make sense now or later down the road to consider pursuing an Investment Advisor/Financial Advisor.  I myself, work for a Boutique RIA firm as a portfolio manager, and am in no way soliciting my business, but instead, I put together a list of questions to use as a guide for the ""Interview Process"".  Before I get into it, my recommendation if you choose to hire an Advisor, make sure they are a Fee-Only Fiduciary, this is usually the most transparent type of advisor out there.  This can protect you from being sold crappy investment products that put money in your advisors pocket that likely aren't best suited for you.

1.       Tell me about your qualifications and experience? 

You NEED to know how long your advisor has been in the industry and what education and designations they have.  The CFP, CFA, and CPA are some of the most prestigious and well-recognized designations that an advisor can have.

2.       What problems can you solve and what services do you provide?

Financial advisors can perform a multitude of different functions, so finding the one that fits your needs and has the expertise you are looking for.  You want an advisor is isn’t just one-dimensional (i.e. only selling insurance products) but rather can offer many different types of advice like real estate, equities, alternatives, etc.

3.       Who else stands to gain from the services you provide me?

You want a clear understanding of any other third parties that aim to benefit off the services your potential advisor is giving you.  Advisors that sell a certain product, mutual fund, or policy typically have a pre-arranged relationship that usually comes in the form of compensation when providing these products.

4.       Have you ever been professionally disciplined?

FINRA, CFA, state agencies, and CFP boards keep records on the disciplinary history of candidates and advisors.  You should verify with these entities if your potential advisor has ever been reprimanded or professionally disciplined.

5.       How secure are your services?

Cybersecurity is a serious issue, so you want to make sure what systems your advising company has in place, how the information is store, what software partners they are working with, and ultimately how is your sensitive data being stored.  At the end of the day, the Financial Advisor is going to have a lot of your personal financial data, so you just want to make sure how secure it really is.

6.       How much control do I have over decisions made?

FAs have different scopes of ability and services.  Some have complete discretion and control over the account with no client input, while other FAs serve as more of an educator and the client does have a lot of input.  If you are looking for someone to make all the investment-management decisions for you, then find an advisor that can serve in that capacity.  If, on the other hand, you are more of a DIY type investor, find an advisor that can serve as a second set of eyes while still giving you the ability to pick what securities or investment vehicles to include in your portfolio.

7.       How are you getting paid?

For any reputable FA can answer this question.  There isn’t one right answer for the fee structure that is best for you, but you definitely want one of transparent.  There are so many types of fee structures, so try to understand how your FA actually gets paid.

8.       Ask him or her to explain a concept to you

This allows you an opportunity to see their ability to communicate effectively.  A large part of the financial planning process comes in the delivery of the plan itself.  Choosing an advisor who can not only develop a comprehensive financial plan but also deliver it in a way that is well understood.

Below are five concept-oriented questions to consider asking:

* What is passive vs. active investing?
* How do you determine how much of my money should be in stocks vs. bonds?
* What is a [laddered bond](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/accounts_products/investment/bonds/individual_bonds/bond_ladders) portfolio?

These are just observations from an experienced investor and FP&amp;A analyst.  Obviously none of this means that outside analysts know everything, but the comprehensive, actionable insight available for** ***you*** **to digest, underlying the forecast period of the DCF analysis, is rarer than the deluge of less useful factoids.**

**tl;dr: The more readily available the so-called ""stock analysis/deep dive"", the greater the skepticism it warrants.**

There is no end to the number of blogs and Youtube videos that convince retail investors they too can be experts.  But what, really, is the value of that information?

There are three reasons earnings-based analyses are so popular in the investing world, even among some quasi-professionals, despite the fact that Discounted Cash Flow analysis is the preferred model for valuation across the entire industry^(1):

1. Earnings is the most readily available company metric on the internet.
2. Ratios are simple; analyses are complicated.
3. This information is cheap.

Beyond Time Value of Money, there's no more valuable information you're going to get from browsing the internet for free.  You can get access to certain types of research reports from Schwab and other discount brokerages, but it's not ""free"".  You've deposited money with and given order flow to these institutions, on which they in turn generate income.  But this is still relatively low value information compared to real, thorough equity research (it's often called ""Due Diligence"" here).  These reports cost money, and they're compiled by people with years of education and expertise, which in turn cost money.

So I'm sitting here next to a stack of just four books from my college years a quarter century ago:

1. *Fundamentals of Financial Management* by Eugene F. Brigham.
2. *Management Accounting* by Anthony Atkinson &amp; Rajiv Banker (my professor).
3. Smith and Roberson's *Business Law.*
4. *Security Analysis* by Dodd and Graham.

The fourth is by far the cheapest of them, because it's more widely used outside academia.  But together, these four books would today cost, in their hardcover editions, $1000... and that's just four introductory textbooks.  Nevermind the 4-5 years of school I had studying the soup-to-nuts of business management and, at the end of it, writing a thesis for a strategy formulation and implementation class that utilized all of the other learned disciplines in the development of a single, semester-long business case.

Very little of what analysts know in practice is something that can be distilled to the average investor without all of the years of underlying context.   Expecting you to digest this and beat the market would be like telling you to take a 5xxx or 7xxx level finance course and expecting you to place in the top 5% of the class, at a top 5% school.

So this is what really goes into business valuation exercises of any real worth.  Which is another way of saying: If you didn't pay for it, chances are it's not that valuable.

I know that *Hulbert Ratings* audit a large selection of such services and compare their returns over different time periods.


Looking at the results on their website, it is clear that two services stand out, i.e. 1) *Nate's Notes* and 2) *Investment Advisory Service*, as having consistently outperformed not only the S&amp;P 500 (by a lot!) but also the Russell 2000, Wilshire 5000 and NASDAQ Composite over different time periods i.e. 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and 20 years.


See the information below taken from *Hulbert Ratings*:


**Historical Performance of Nate's Notes (Model Portfolio) / Investor Advisory Service / NASDAQ Composite / S&amp;P 500 (with dividends reinvested):**


- 3 years: 27.6% / 24.5% / 23.5% / 18.1% p.a.
- 5 years: 24.0% / 25.6% / 24.0% / 18.0% p.a.
- 10 years: 20.5% / 19.2% / 19.5% / 16.3% p.a.
- 15 years: 15.0% / 14.8% / 13.8% / 10.9% p.a.
- 20 years: 15.7% / 13.5% / 11.3% / 9.3% p.a.


From my research, *Nate's Notes* has been published from the beginning (1995) by a single person, i.e. Nate Pile. Also, the Editor-In-Chief of *Investment Advisory Service*, Douglas Gerlach, has held this position since 2003. 


So for both of these services, it appears that the key people that contributed to the strong historical performance of these newsletters are still active.


**However, despite their impressive record I don't see these newsletters being recommended on reddit or many reviews of these services online (i.e. when Google searching ""Nate's Notes review"" or ""Investor Advisory Service review""). What am I missing? Does anyone know the reason for this?**


*Nate's Notes* ""Model Portfolio"" has out-performed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 6% p.a. over the last 20 years and *Investor Advisory Service* has outperformed by more than 4% p.a. Compounded over 20 years that's a big difference in absolute returns!


I realise that many people have the view that investors should not rely too much on stock-picking services but rather it's best to learn how to invest yourself and then pick your own stocks following thorough research. My view is that such stock-picking services can be a good compliment to your own research and in the case of these services, potentially an opportunity to learn methods that have consistently outperformed the market over both very long and short time periods.


A number of people recommend The Motley Fool's products such as *Stock Advisor*. From my research, there does appear to be evidence that the *Stock Advisor* service has historically outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index over different time periods (see the academic paper titled *Evaluating the performance of the Motley Fool’s Stock Advisor™*), however I do have the following concerns about The Motley Fool / *Stock Advisor*:

- Though *Stock Advisor* has consistently outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since inception, according to the above academic paper, the strongest out-performance was in the first few years i.e. 2002 - 2006. The out-performance has significantly decreased since then.
- The *Stock Advisor* recommendations are tech heavy so you could argue that the returns of this service should be compared to the NASDAQ Composite which has performed much better during the last 20 years than the S&amp;P 500. I'm not sure if there would still be an out-performance with this comparison.
- Motley Fool have a large number of services. My understanding is that many such services have been discontinued following significant under-performance relative to the index. This would imply selection bias which could be a cause for concern!
- David Gardner's *Stock Advisor* picks out-performed his brother, Tom Gardner's, by a lot! David is no longer directly involved in stock-picking, therefore it is unclear how the Rule Breakers team will perform without him.

Anyway, the above are my thoughts following some research on stock-picking services. I'm keen to get views on this from the reddit */investing* community: particularly on why *Nate's Notes* and *Investor Advisory Service* are not more well known / recommended on reddit / online in general."|0.74|15.0|0.0|15.0|"['*Investor Advisory Service*', 'Investor Advisory Service', ""Nate's Notes"", '*Hulbert Ratings', ""*Nate's Notes"", 'Investment Advisory Service', 'The Motley Fool / *Stock Advisor', 'Wilshire', '*Investor Advisory Service', '*Investment Advisory Service', ""The Motley Fool's"", 'Hulbert Ratings', 'Rule Breakers', 'reddit', 'Motley Fool', '*Stock Advisor*', '*Stock Advisor']"

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side and never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&amp;P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, let consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and for every subsequent year increased your investments by 5%. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns : S&amp;P 500 (1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f96f61-9b99-4d4a-b6cd-88eece3ecc1d_624x241.png)

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.     

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

Since the past few days, Abbvie stock has fallen a bit and I'm trying to understand if it is worth buying. I already have a long position and was like to buy more.

The fall is mainly attributed to the FDA decision regarding it's drug Rinvoq where the company has to put a label regarding associated heart risks as side effects of the medicine. Due to this the projected revenues of this drug in 2025 has been reduced from about 8 billions to 3 billions.

There's this statistic around that ~90% of investors underperform the market. A safe (-ish) and easy way of investing is therefore to just dump money into an index, especially for long term growth. 

The world economy is heavily linked to the US economy, which is best represented by the S&amp;P500 because this index is very general and has a lot of companies. The S&amp;P500 has grown a lot all through history, and there is never a point where the world economy grows yet the S&amp;P does not. So whenever there is something to gain, you will gain with just following S&amp;P.

Then, if you live in a non-US country you might want some exposure to your own country economy. Because that's where you will be earning and spending money in general. I live in Switzerland, which is a rich and stable country, so I can hold savings in the SMI index and they will follow Swiss economy.

Another way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus one of the many small cap companies looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars, the hype has already consumed supply such as lithium battery stocks.

This discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/om9772/what_are_your_underappreciated_offtheradar_picks/h5kxnlz/) describing these kind of stock picks:

&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I've owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.

&gt;TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there's a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher. Just like ENTG in the example above, Thermo is a supplier to the whole industry. While those biotechs remain unprofitable, the suppliers are getting paid and Thermo is making absolute bank in a rapid growth industry and yet it trades at a PE of 20...absurd. It'll double or triple in a couple years.

&gt;I'm an engineer focused on raw materials, so I'm a bit biased but I have seen suppliers make money hand over fist while the companies buying these things are burning cash or barely scraping by. Thats what drove me to look in to high-moat suppliers in the first place and I will continue to.

t3_pp5xta|1631764757.0|investing|Theoretical question about the benefits of using Smartlands vs. traditional refinancing.|"
So, this is specifically for real estate. Generally, if you own your (residential, at least) property, you can get an equity based loan at the going rate to get some cash. I know Ukraine rates are higher than the US, but are they that much higher? Pretty sure you can do a home equity loan for like 6%, and I have to assume larger commercial loans are even lower. Plus they could do a full refinance for even lower rates in the 2-3% range. I don't see how tokenizing and effectively selling 40% of your building and forfeiting a percentage of future profits is a better deal than getting a loan from a bank for 40% of the building's value at a 2-6% interest rate... and getting to keep all the profits on top of that. Unless Ukraine interest rates are like 15-20% or something, seems like the bank is a better option. I'm probably just missing something, but my question is what is the draw to bring future properties in? Why would they choose this route over traditional finance?



I definitely get the SME side, but still trying to wrap my head around the benefits for real estate owners. Are they selling portions of the property they still owe money on? That seems quite risky. Maybe I am just not savvy enough on the costs associated with taking cash out of commercial properties. I'm quite excited about this project regardless for the SME side but any clarification on the real estate side would be appreciated."|0.83|17.0|0.0|17.0|[]
t3_pp0jnw|1631744925.0|investing|What are some of your favorite duopolies?|"Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. 

My question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: 

$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. 

$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (S&amp;P500 +100%) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. 

Semiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. 

What are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.

3. Live your life (spend $400k-$1m/yr doing whatever it is rich people do)

https://twitter.com/Fxhedgers/status/1438016209765605377

&gt;FITCH WIRE: FITCH DOWNGRADED CHINA EVERGRANDE GROUP TO 'CC' FROM 'CCC+' ON 7 SEPT, INDICATING THAT WE VIEW A DEFAULT OF SOME KIND AS PROBABLE

More context:

https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/

&gt;Rating agency Fitch said that numerous sectors could be exposed to heightened credit risk if China's No.2 property developer Evergrande Group (3333.HK) were to default, although the overall impact on the banking sector would be manageable.

&gt;Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing. read more

&gt;Regulators have warned of broader risks to the country's financial system if the company's $305 billion of liabilities aren't contained.

&gt;""We believe a default would reinforce credit polarisation among homebuilders and could result in headwinds for some smaller banks,"" Fitch said in a note late on Tuesday.

&gt;Fitch downgraded China Evergrande Group to ""CC"" from ""CCC+"" on Sep. 7, indicating that it viewed a default of some kind as probable.

&gt;On Tuesday, Evergrande said it has engaged advisers to examine its financial options and warned of cross-default risks amid plunging property sales and lack of progress in asset disposals. read more

&gt;Fitch said 572 billion yuan ($88.8 billion) of Evergrande's borrowings were held by banks and other financial institutions, but banks may also have indirect exposure to the developer's suppliers, who are owed 667 billion yuan for goods and services.

&gt;""Smaller banks with higher exposure to Evergrande or to other vulnerable developers could face significant increases in non-performing loans (NPLs), depending on how any credit event involving Evergrande develops,"" Fitch said.

&gt;But the agency added a recent People’s Bank of China sensitivity test showed the average capital adequacy ratio of the 4,000 banks in the country would only drop modestly if the NPL ratio for property-development loans were to rise by 15 basis points.

&gt;Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed stock slipped as much as another 5% to HK$2.82 on Wednesday morning, a fresh low since Jan 2014.

&gt;Its property management unit (6666.HK) and EV unit (0708.HK), however, bounced as much as 10.4% and 9.3%, respectively.

&gt;In the debt market, Evergrande's Shanghai traded July 2022 bond fell 5.6% to 28.3 yuan, while its dollar bond due March 2022 dropped 20% to 27.502 cents, yielding more than 500%.

&gt;Fitch also said the risk of significant pressure on house prices in the event of a default would be low, and it expected the government would act to protect households’ interests to ensure home deliveries.

&gt;On Wednesday, roughly 40 protesters stood near the entrance at Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, prevented from going inside by dozens of security personnel.

&gt;This followed chaotic scenes at the headquarters two days earlier, as disgruntled investors crowded its lobby to demand repayment of loans and financial products.

OXY/WS is the cheapest way to invest in OXY if you believe the share price will go up significantly. They essentially give you the right to buy shares at $22 plus the current warrant price. You have up until Aug 3 2027 to exercise this right. These warrants were issued to OXY shareholders during hard times in 2020, to throw them a bone, but I imagine most bailed as the stock collapsed. 

Four reasons I like this play are…

1. Rising Free Cash Flow. Occidential petroleum has been benefiting from an increasing WTI crude oil price, hovering around $70/barrel as of today. Last quarter it averaged around $65/barrel, and they had cash flow in that quarter above 2 billion (market cap is currently ~24.4 billion for reference). Cash flow should continue to increase as crude price increases, and they work to pay down their crippling debt.

2. The Crippling Debt is Going Away. No one likes debt, right? Especially crippling debt that might bankrupt you in a sudden, extreme downturn? *cough* Covid 2020 *cough*. Apparently management got the message that their debt load could kill them, and have a plan to reduce debt by over 40%, planning to drop from 34 billion in debt at the end of 2020 to 20 billion in debt at the end of 2022. As debt gets paid down the current interest payments of 300+ million/quarter will reduce to under 200 million/quarter, adding over half a billion extra to their free cash flow!

3. Inflation Hedge. OXY has a lot of hard assets, and if US inflation takes off their stock should rise. An example of these hard assets can be found in their land holdings- they own over 1.35 million acres in the permian basin alone. If inflation is high over the next 6 years, I feel the time value of OXY/WS is being very underappreciated. As of today that time value is under $6 per warrant. 

4. Future Energy Needs. Going back to the permian basin, the land that oxy has might one day be reused for alternative energy. Believe it or not, massive solar projects can hit a wall due to environmental groups. Below’s a link of this issue recently cropping up in San Diego County. For some reason, I don’t think Texas will give a damn about environmental issues, making that previously mentioned 1.35 million acres in the permian basin prime real estate for massive solar projects. In addition to solar potential, OXY has also been working on CO2 sequestering using their pre-existing oil drilling footprint.

 TERMINATION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES PROGRAM

This announcement is made by China Telecom Corporation Limited (the “Company”) on a voluntary basis.

We refer to the announcement of the Company dated 7 May 2021 in relation to the review decision by The New York Stock Exchange LLC (the “NYSE”) that the NYSE determined to delist the American Depositary Shares of the Company (the “ADSs”).

The delisting of the Company’s ADSs has taken effect on 18 May 2021. In light of the delisting, the board of directors (the “Board”) of the Company resolved to terminate the ADSs program (the “ADS Program”) on 9 September 2021. On the same day, the Company entered into a letter agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon, as the depositary for the Company’s ADSs, for the termination of the ADS Program.

As of 9 September 2021, the number of ADSs in issue was approximately 0.813 million and the number of H shares underlying the ADSs represented approximately 0.09% of the Company’s total issued shares. The Bank of New York Mellon has given a notice to all holders of ADSs that the ADS Program will terminate on 8 December 2021 (U.S. Eastern time) (the “Termination Date”). Holders of ADSs will have the right, at least until the Termination Date, to return the ADSs to The Bank of New York Mellon in exchange for H shares of the Company with each ADS returned to be exchanged into 100 H shares of the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement. The Company’s H shares are traded on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The Bank of New York Mellon expects to commence the sale of H shares of the Company represented by the remaining ADSs as soon as practicable after the Termination Date, and will pay the net cash proceeds, after deducting applicable fees and expenses, to the holders of such remaining ADSs."|0.56|2.0|0.0|2.0|['The Bank of New York Mellon', 'The New York Stock Exchange LLC', 'China Telecom Corporation', 'China Telecom Corporation Limited', 'The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited']

Press release:  https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm

&gt;The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.3 percent in
August on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.5 percent in July, the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items
index increased 5.3 percent before seasonal adjustment.

&gt;The indexes for gasoline, household furnishings and operations, food, and shelter
all rose in August and contributed to the monthly all items seasonally adjusted
increase. The energy index increased 2.0 percent, mainly due to a 2.8-percent
increase in the gasoline index. The index for food rose 0.4 percent, with the
indexes for food at home and food away from home both increasing 0.4 percent. 

&gt;The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.1 percent in August, its
smallest increase since February 2021. Along with the indexes for household
operations and shelter, the indexes for new vehicles, recreation, and medical care
also rose in August. The indexes for airline fares, used cars and trucks, and
motor vehicle insurance all declined over the month.  

&gt;The all items index rose 5.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller
increase than the 5.4-percent rise for the period ending July. The index for all
items less food and energy rose 4.0 percent over the last 12 months, also a
smaller increase than the period ending July. The energy index rose 25.0 percent
over the last 12 months, and the food index increased 3.7 percent; both were
larger than the increases for the 12-month period ending July.

t3_pnuir6|1631588614.0|investing|How would I become a private investor?|"I am 18 years old and a sophomore in college (in the USA). I am a business major, as business/investing has been pretty much a passion for me since I discovered it. I love the field and enjoy it. 

I started getting into stocks when I was 16. I also did an internship at a company that summer and was able to “shadow” the owner to see what running a company is like. Learned a lot and it was interesting even though it was only a month there. Wish it could be longer, it was a different country too. 

After a year of investing and researching the stock market every single day, I decided to make the big jump and start an e-commerce store. I was still under 18 and had to use my parents behalf to start it. It was a big jump. The website and products were great, but the only issue was that I didn’t know how to drive traffic and customers that were going to make a purchase. I didn’t know how to market my products. And just because a business is visually good it doesn’t mean that the business can perform well. Starting my own business was great, I learned more in those 2 months (I know its short) than I did in my freshman year of college. 

This was the only issue, however I did learn how important every part of a business is., and how one bad part of a business can cause it to fail. I also had to learn some basic marketing stuff on my free time. 

So for the next year and a half I started to get involved in any sort of investing I can do at my age. 
Ive created business models/ideas as well on the side to safe as future reference.

Ive noticed my strengths in the business field, and I think being a private investor might be a good option in the future. Heck, I love all types of investing in general lol. Maybe I could start investing in different industries privately. 

How would I start being a private investor (starting small of course. More in startups, different industries etc)? Is this something I can right out of college or even before if I have enough capital? Do I need to be an Accredited Investor and have a better background?"|0.51|1.0|0.0|1.0|[]
t3_pnsazh|1631580430.0|investing|The market is strong: correcting some common misconceptions about the market being unstable|"Hi everyone, there's been a whole lot of talk about a market crash on reddit lately. Most of that chatter comes from WSB and not this sub but there is still some talk of it on this sub. I wanted to give my 2 cents on the issue and start a discussion on the topic. I usually see people talking about market crashes on reddit referring to 3 key issues: the price of equities, inflation, and reverse repo. I am going to address all of those here.

**The price of equities**

Many people are worried about the soaring prices of stocks right now. If you take a look at the SPX or NDX or really any index, the RSI will say that it's oversold. Additionally, the market hasn't had a 5% correction since October of LAST YEAR. Even more, the market is making new all time highs almost every single month and it seems like the stock market just keeps going up and won't stop. Despite all of this, I am not sold in the least bit on this being a cause for a market crash. First, if you take a look at the SPX historically, we've had bull runs last longer and gain more on a percentage basis than this current one (I plan on doing a DD on that in the near future). Additionally, it makes sense for the market to be at these levels - earnings are consistency out of the park for most companies. Most importantly, however, is the FED's actions. The FED's QE policies can be described in no way but aggressive. The FED has been purchasing bonds and such since the 2008 recession, but has aggressively picked this up because of covid. The effect that this has is it makes bond prices go extremely high, which is why yields are so low. When yields are that low and inflation fears are persistent, investors can only put their money in the stock market if they want to make returns that outpace inflation. This is even more evident if you simply google ""SPX FED balance sheet."" Doing this will show you pictures of how the SPX moves directly proportional to the size of the FED's balance sheet. In conclusion, I believe that it makes complete and total sense that the market is at this current level. Are we due for a pullback in the near future? Probably. But is a giant looming correction coming? I don't think so in the least bit.

**Inflation**

Many people also say that inflation is what will destroy the stock market. I am not going to discuss whether I believe inflation is transitory or not because that will take up way too much time and is another issue in its own right. To analyze why I don't believe inflation would cause a market crash, let's look at several factors. First, let's look at history. The greatest inflation in the US was in the 1970's and 1980's. We didn't see a market crash in the least bit in the 1970's and in the 1980's we saw a very strong bull market. Next, lets assume for a minute that inflation does get a bit out of hand. If prices get out of control, the idea is that the economy will slow down because consumer spending will decrease, which will lead to lower earnings and fewer jobs. However, I don't believe this will happen because of the FED. The FED has shown us time and time again that it is here to support the stock market. If we see inflation, yes, maybe the FED will raise rates but the stock market has grown so accustomed to QE policies, I don't think the FED will just end them to stop inflation. Instead, I think that the FED will do something to stimulate the market in a different way - perhaps through more targeted bond purchases or something in that nature. The point is, I see absolutely no scenario where the FED just says ""sorry baby"" to the market to stop inflation.

**Reverse Repo**

Seeing people talk about how RRP transaction amounts being at records is an indication that the economy is going to crash is something that really annoys me because it shows an absolute and total misunderstanding of the subject. People who say this see that RRP total overnight transactions have been hitting records basically every week - this is completely correct, they have been getting into the trillions lately. People see this and immediately think MARKET CRASH. However, this shows a complete and total misunderstanding of RRP. The only time that RRP stats are a cause for concern is when the RATE goes up. When the rate goes up, it means that institutions see overnight lending as risky and want more compensation for it - we saw this in 2019 and the FED quickly addressed it. The current reason why RRP total transactions are rising because the FED is trying to put more liquidity into the system in order to spur economic growth - this is exactly what the FED wants to happen. The FED wants excess liquidity to be in the system. Economic crises often start when there is a credit crunch - i.e. large institutions are hesitant to lend because of some systemic risk or downturn. Reverse repo numbers show the exact opposite - they show that there is excess lending activity in the system.

**Conclusion**

Thanks for listening to my rant. I think that the economy is completely fine right now. Yes, there will probably be a slight correction in the near future due to delta concerns or just the general market cycle but I do not in the slightest bit believe that there will be a market crash in the foreseeable future.

t3_pnjnkb|1631552689.0|investing|How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style. Part 2.|"This is the second installment to a post I made back in May that documented some of my inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's 13F plays. People on other subs found the information in part 1 useful so I thought I'd make a part 2 specifically for the broader audience on r/Investing.

By my estimate, 28.4% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio is currently hedging against inflation. I arrived at this number by going through the individual positions of Scion's Q2 2021 13F, using the ""Think Back"" function in ThinkOrSwim to estimate options contracts prices, and summing the resulting positions together.

# US 20+ year Treasury ETFs (7.6% of Scion's Q2 2021 portfolio)

Burry's treasury instrument of choice is the 20+ year bond. This is a direct play on inflation where he's essentially concluding that the Fed will eventually need to raise interest rates which will lead to an increase in bond yields thereby causing their prices to fall. TLT is tied to the bond price itself. TBT is tied to the inverse of the yield (so when the yield falls, TBT goes up 2x that rate (in theory)).

He has positions in both TLT and TBT (see below for descriptions). It should be noted that both of these positions first appeared in Scion's 13F in Q1 2021. It should also be noted that he reduced his TBT position and increased his TLT position in Q2 2021. His TLT position is the third largest position in his Q2 2021 portfolio (which, in my opinion, says something about which ETF he prefers).

**Put Options on** [Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)](https://investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) **- 7.2% of current holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates, leading to increased yields and making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

Some context: The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds (link).

**Call Options on** [Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treas etf (TBT)](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) **- 0.4% of holdings**

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on a 2x inverse bond ETF.

Context: The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

# Energy, Commodities, and Transport (11% of current holdings)

Commodities are a fairly traditional inflation play. This [article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020816/importance-commodity-pricing-understanding-inflation.asp) on investopedia gets into some of the details regarding the relationship between commodities and inflation. The challenge with each of these companies is determining whether the company is an explicit hedge against inflation or whether it’s a value investing play.

[Ovintiv Inc.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ovintiv-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-and-operating-results-301342593.html) **(Pan Canadian Energy - Encana Corp.) (OVV) - 4.06% of current holdings**

This is the 6th largest Scion position and the 2nd largest shares-only position (i.e., no options contracts).

Probable Thesis: First, it's an oil &amp; gas company (meaning the commodities checkbox is checked on this one). Second, it's arguably a riskier investment at the moment. They have very little cash on the balance sheet (enough for 1 day of operations). They are currently redirecting their cash flow towards paying down long-term debt which in itself is another positive for inflationary times (one group that does particularly well during inflation is debtors as the debt inflates itself away).

[Scorpio Tankers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4438157-scorpio-tankers-has-more-upside) **(STNG), SunCoke Energy (SXC), and** [Golden Ocean Group Limited](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOGL) **(GOGL) - 2.9%, 2.4%, and 1.7%**

I grouped these positions together as they each clock in below 3% of the overall portfolio. Each of these was also an existing position that Burry added to in Q2 2021.

***Scorpio Tankers and Golden Ocean Group***

These two are likely plays on ocean freight/transport inflation. Scorpio is tied to oil transport and is a proxy play on any boost to oil demand that occurs at the global level. Golden Ocean Group looks similar but tied specifically to dry bulk goods.

***SunCoke Energy***

This is the one that I'm leaning more towards ""value investing play"" and less towards inflation (but I could be wrong). The arguments in favor of it being an inflation play are that it’s a commodity company (coal), it just recently started paying a dividend, and its been working towards deleveraging (at least that was the case earlier in the year). These are themes that you'll see in other investments such as CVS Health below.

# Revenue Mammoths (9.8% of current holdings)

The final group of companies are the revenue mammoths. They hail from the retail, grocery, and pharmacy sectors. All four of these organizations are in the top 31 companies in the world by revenue. They have some combination of pharmaceutical distribution and retail/grocery. They offer dividends with two of them being dividend aristocrats.

**CVS Health (Call Options and Shares) - 4.7% of portfolio**

Interestingly, CVS Health is the only stock where Burry is currently holding both shares and call options. They are the [7th largest company in the world by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue) (hence the revenue mammoth term).

The characteristics that make CVS an interesting potential inflation play are:

• They have a large pharmaceutical distribution presence

• They have a large health insurance segment

• They have a sizeable retail store segment

• They froze their dividend in 2018 to pay down debt related to their Aetna acquisition

What makes these intriguing characteristics from the inflation perspective?

Healthcare and pharmaceuticals have consistently beaten inflation over the past several decades. Pharmaceutical drugs continue to trend up. CVS owns a pharmacy benefits manager which, as a business, is incentivized through proportional rebates to push pricier drugs where they can.

From the retail perspective, their ""front"" stores are essentially baskets of goods which can pass on the costs of inflation to the consumer.

Lastly, the most intriguing reason (in my opinion) is their current strategy to pay down long-term debt. Their stock price is arguably depressed due to the massive $69 billion acquisition of Aetna they made in 2018. They had been increasing dividends every year for almost 2 decades before this acquisition, at which point they froze the dividend and put the money towards their debt. They estimate that they'll hit their debt-to-capitalization ratio in Spring of next year (I personally think it will be summer or fall of next year). At that point, it is anticipated that they will resume dividend hikes and share buybacks as they've done historically.

With CVS, you have a potential case where the 7th largest company in the world by revenue is undervalued due to a large amount of debt that they are slowly and steadily paying off in an advantageous inflationary environment with a predicted return to hiking their dividends in 2022 (and they appear to be largely inflation-proof).

**The Opioid Twins: McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health (Call Options only) - 2.9% of portfolio**

Two more pharmaceutical revenue mammoths: McKesson clocks in at #12 on the largest companies by revenue list and is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. They also own a chain of 4000 pharmacy stores. Cardinal Health clocks in at 14th by revenue and is in the top 5 largest pharmaceutical distributors with McKesson. Both offer similar inflation characteristics to the ones listed for CVS Health with the difference being that CVS owns a health insurance plan on top of their pharmacy retail/PBM businesses.

Another key difference between CVS Health and the duo of McKesson and Cardinal is that McKesson and Cardinal Health were penalized in July of 2021 for their role in the Opioid crisis. Cardinal Health [expects to pay $6.4 billion over 18 years](https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/2021/07/22/cardinal-health-pay-6-4-billion-part-opioid-settlement/8053626002/) for its share of a $26 billion opioid settlement. It's possible that this legislation is currently a drag on these two stocks.

**Walmart (Call Options only) - 1% of portfolio**

Walmart is an interesting case because, at first glance, it appears to make more sense as an inflation play than the rest of this mammoth revenue group. Walmart is the largest company on Earth by yearly revenue. They have a strong pharmaceutical presence like the other companies in this category though over half of their revenue is actually from their grocery segment.

What makes them an interesting inflation play is that their stores are literally giant baskets of goods. They have a large breadth of products which allows them to keep the prices of various product categories lower than their competitors. They also own the basket that the goods live in (along with the land around the basket). Real Estate is a well-known inflation hedge.

Beijing wants to break up Alipay, the 1bn plus-user superapp owned by Jack Ma’s Ant Group, and create a separate app for the company’s highly profitable loans business, in the most visible restructuring yet of the fintech giant.

Chinese regulators have already ordered Ant to separate the back end of its two lending businesses, Huabei, which is similar to a traditional credit card, and Jiebei, which makes small unsecured loans, from the rest of its financial offerings and bring in outside shareholders. Now officials want the two businesses to be split into an independent app as well.

The plan will also see Ant turn over the user data that underpins its lending decisions to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned, according to two people familiar with the process.

“The government believes big tech’s monopoly power comes from their control of data,” said one person close to financial regulators in Beijing. “It wants to end that.”

The move may slow down Ant’s lending business, with the enormous growth of Huabei and Jiebei partly powering its planned IPO last year. The CreditTech unit, which includes the two units, overtook Ant’s main payment processing business for the first time in the first half of 2020, to account for 39 per cent of the group’s revenues.

If I buy bonds I want a high yield, right? Yield is the return I’m getting on that bond. So if I buy a $10,000 bond with a coupon rate of 10%, yearly coupon is $1,000 interest income. But I also want to buy this $10,000 bond for a discounted price. Let’s say $6,000 discount bond price.  So my yield is ($1000/$6,000) = .1666666. 

If I bought the bond at a premium, let’s say $10,300. My yield is lower. ($1000/$10300) = .097

So if interest rates are expected to rise due to inflation, bond prices are going to drop? Thus bond yields will go up?

And if interest rates go down, bond prices rise, and yields decrease?

Basically, the big question we all have to ask ourselves is what is the longterm annualized return on the SP500 if we invest at these levels? I have seen people calculate this based on the current forward PE estimate and I believe this is highly dangerous!

Here is the common argument I see on here:

SP500 forward PE is at 22. Therefore we have a 4.5% earnings yield. Then given historical real earnings growth of the SP500 of 2%, we should see a 6.5% real return if investing at these levels. This isn't bad comparing to negative real yield offered by TIPs. And a measily nominal yield of 1.34% nominal yield of the 10yr. Therefore SP500 is fairly attractive.

However, I don't think we should be assuming the real earnings implied by the forward PE is a reasonable starting place for this calculation. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is what we see in the next couple of years, but can we really assume this will last? Current forward PE of 22 on SP500 at 4500 means we expect to see 205 in real earnings which I will argue cannot last outside of the next few years.

Instead here are what I believe to be more accurate depiction of what the true earnings will be going forward on a real, averaged level. This will determine forward annualized returns.

**Estimate 1: 2019 real earnings is 140.  (Also max real earnings of SP500 is 140).**

This isn't the most reliable estimate but it is telling. The reason that it is telling is that it is the pre-covid earnings of the SP500 and recent. Not only that but it is also the all time high real earnings for the SP500 and occurs after a period of recovery fueled by extreme debt. Now of course 2019 is backward looking so if we account using a 2% real earnings growth rate, then we get to 148 in SP500 real earnings going forward.

**Estimate 2: CAPE Ratio is 40 implying 112.5 in real earnings. However, it is the previous 10 year average so adjusting for earnings growth the ratio is 36.5.  This implies 120 in real earnings.**

Now CAPE ratio, as it is the PE ratio with E being the average of the last 10 years of inflation adjusted earnings, is somewhat backward looking. Although it does account for inflation it does not account for natural growth in earnings. If we take the historical geometric mean of 2% annualized real earnings growth and adjust CAPE for this, then the CAPE ratio is 36.5 or about 120 in real earnings. This better reflects what earnings are likely to be going forward. Personally I believe this estimate to be the most fair measurement.

**Forward PE predicts 205 in real earnings for SP500.**

This tells me one should not use the forward PE for SP500 to forecast the earnings of the SP500 for the next decade as it would be 50% above all time high earnings that occurred in 2019. It is also 70% more than 10 year averaged earnings (with an adjustment for earnings growth and inflation to make it more realistic).

So we cannot possibly expect forward PE to give us a meaningful idea of the levels we are investing in! The danger is that forward PE may convince investors they will likely earn a 4.5% yield+2% growth = 6.5% long term real annualized return (say 30 years) by investing at these levels and maybe a drawdown to say a 10PE would only mean a 50% decline.

However, more realistically, investors in SP500 will likely have a 2.7% yield + 2% growth = 4.7% real long term annualized return by investing in the SP500. Also if we are to revert to a 10 CAPE this could imply a drawdown as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

**TL;DR**

Your long term rate of return for the SP500 at these levels will not be 10% real. It will not even be 6.5% real which using the forward PE as the basis for yield would imply. Instead it will likely be closer to 4.7% real with the risk of a drawdown as big as 75% in the near to medium term.

Now I'm not saying to hold cash, gold, crypto or whatever instead. I think stocks are the most sensible long term investment still because a 4.7% real return is still nice. However, they aren't for everyone! You will only realize this level of return in the long term and in the interim your portfolio could be down 50-75% meaning you would have a HEFTY penalty if you had to take out early. So is this hefty penalty worth it for the 5% real return? This is what we must ask."|0.79|65.0|0.0|65.0|['SP500']

t3_plip72|1631271198.0|investing|Major crisis were led by property crisis.|"Urban construction, modernisation and so, is the main investment done by governments to boost the economy, because urbanisation attracts investments and cities created big consume demands. But these investments are the major forces leasing to the main crises at least since 1870.

When France economy was starting getting weak in the middle of XIX century they invested in modernising Paris is a huge scale. It workerd to attract investment and to create demand for business but eventually it lead to the late 1860s crises resulting the the famous Paris Commune. The war against Bismark's Prussia was an other way to attempt to invest the eccess of capital.

The very same strategy was the urban development in NY and other major cities in America leading and the property crisis in the midle of 1920s preciding the big economic crash.

The  american suburb development in the 1940s excluding minorities, especially the black community,  and the bored suburb middle class kids, lead the 68 protests.

After changes in the economy for a more Neoliberal strategy, giving much more power to capitalists acumulation investments in urban development became more frequent and so the cycle of crisis.

The crisis of 1973 originated in a global property market crash; it wasn't really the oil prices as mainstream economics like to suggest. The property crash happen 6 months before the oil price hike and recession was well under way by the fall.

Commercial property lead the Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s in the US.

The end of Japan boom in 1990 corresponded to a collapse of land prices.

Nationalisation of Swedish banking system in 1992 because of eccess in property markets.

One of the teiggers for the collapse in East and South East Asia in 1997-98 was the eccessive urban development in Thailand.

Since urbain development have been intensified in the past 20 years I assume that keeping an eye on the property market is a good idea as a sinal for major crisis approaching.

The greater the share of property markets in GDP, the more significant the connection between financing and investment in the built environment becomes a major source of macro crisis.

In the US where housing mortgage was equivalent of 40% of GDP it mostly certainly generated  a crisis in 2007-09.

t3_plin6t|1631270936.0|investing|The demand for copper against the copper supply|"Seeing the current situation, I strongly believe that the demand for copper will just keep on rising, so the prices will also rise unless we find more copper or some other economic alternative.

This brings me to the question about the possibility of the supply to meet the demand. Copper is important for the production of electronic devices and of renewable sources of energy. To add to that, it is also important for everything that’s electric, manufacturing batteries, and even for solar panels. There is a high demand for it and it is unlikely that it will go down soon.

There are a lot of big mining companies that are producing massive amounts of copper such as Codelco. Just last year, Codelco was the largest producer of copper, producing 1.73 million tonnes, which was 1.3% higher than their last year’s performance. BHP, which owns the world’s largest copper mine, comes in second producing 1.77 million tonnes.

A lot of smaller companies are joining as well too, and are in for producing tons of the metal too as shown by their drilling results. I believe that these smaller and new companies will contribute greatly to the copper supply boost, which will also help ease the situation of the rising prices.

Among them is Three Valley Copper ([TVC.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tvc.v/)), a Canadian company producing pure copper cathodes from its mineral reserves. They recently released their second-quarter results, where they announced that they were able to mine 178,105 tonnes of ore from Don Gabriel. The company expects high unit costs throughout the year until next year since they are aiming to operate below capacity. There are also explorations that are showing potential like Wedgemount Resources who recently found new mineralized zones. Both senior and junior mining companies are striving hard to keep up with the demand for the metal.

As years go by, I believe copper is going to be really critical and will be a mainstay in a lot of industries. I know that a lot of companies are striving to meet the demand for this metal, but if it does not match the rate of the increase on demand for copper, the supply will likely be short and the prices will continue to increase."|0.93|329.0|0.0|329.0|['Codelco', 'BHP', 'Three Valley Copper', 'Wedgemount Resources']

Were contracts for Dec and further forward expiry already trading prior to today or no?

Is the typical effect on the price as the contract expiration nears convergence to spot? Is it not the case that everyone who does not intend to actually take delivery will effectively begin to evaporate from the market as the expiration date nears?

During my studies in the EU, my fellow students introduced me to the investments in P2P lending platforms.

While all of them were receiving interest rates 20 times higher than in banks.

Everything got to the point that my fellow students, being EU citizens, began to take loans in banks and invest these funds in these microloans.

Sounds crazy, but it works for now.

I decided to try.

Having invested 8K, in 18 months I received 1258 Euros of income, which amounted to about 10.5% per annum.

After moving back to the United States, I discovered new opportunities with Prosper.

It was a terrible experience.

On Mintos, I was not limited in the amount of investment, and most importantly, I did not have any time limits, since the vast majority of loans were microloans for a short period (up to 2 months).

But in Prosper, you could invest for a period starting from 36 months, and the fee could reach up to 2%, in Mintos it is fixed at 0.85%.

In the end, I was refused because I could not show my gross income over 80.000 $ Plus.

Also, there was no secondary market on Prosper where you could quickly and with a premium resell your investment.

Fortunately, I still have a European SEPA bank account in Euros and continue to invest in Mintos.

Of course, the system is not perfect:

1) You can earn more than 12% (the maximum that can be earned on the platform is 30% per annum), but then you get into loans with a rating of C- and below, and defaults can sometimes reach more than 30%.

After all, the risk is all yours!

2) When transferring money to a European bank from the United States, after I left the EU, I had slight difficulties.

My payment was frozen by the bank due to suspected money laundering. I had to submit documents on the origin of money through the Bank of America, and explain why, being in the USA and being a US citizen, I transfer money to a European bank, and for what purposes it will be used. It is good that they did not demand to obtain a license for investment activities.

3) When converting from Dollars to Euros and from Euros to Dollars, you have to lose up to 4%.

From now on, I intend to increase my investment to 20K dollars, I will continue to invest in Mintos, and also try a new platform that uses crypt and promises interest rates two times higher than the European one.  


I will try to write monthly reports.

If I sell $10k worth of RSUs right at the vest, $2.2k (22%) should have already withheld for me at the vest. My actual tax responsibility was $3.5k (35%). So this means that I would need to withhold $1.3k of what I sold to pay taxes at tax season.

If my usual tax return is about $1k, I'd now owe $300.

So on that sale of $10k, I actually keep $8.7k. If I didn't sell, I'd still be responsible for paying the $1.3k.

Are my math and reasoning correct here?

I.e., I'd need to always sell an extra 13% of my shares to pay for taxes at vest; I keep 87% of what I sell."|0.65|5.0|0.0|5.0|[]

Sources said the decision to freeze new video game approvals was revealed at a meeting between Chinese authorities and industry giants Tencent and NetEase
It is unclear how long this suspension of new game approvals will last, the sources said  
  
The Chinese government has temporarily suspended approval for all new online games in the country, dealing a fresh blow to the video gaming businesses of industry giants Tencent Holdings and NetEase, as Beijing steps up measures to tackle gaming addiction among young people, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  
That decision was revealed during a meeting on Wednesday called by Chinese authorities, led by the publicity department of the Chinese Communist Party and gaming watchdog the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), to discuss with representatives from Tencent and NetEase how they will implement Beijing’s new restrictions on video gaming for minors, according to a person briefed on the matter, but declined to be named because the information is private.  
The authorities’ move means “everything is on hold”, the person said.

I read about call/put options here all the time, but I've never once seen anyone mention more ""exotic"" derivatives like Knock Out warrants (which I discovered through my broker recently).

I'm curious if people don't use them because they feel they're an inferior choice, because their broker simply doesn't have them and they haven't heard of them, or another reason.

&gt; (In simple terms, A KO C 12/99 warrant is like a call option (but issued by a bank) that doesn't have a time limit, doesn't have time or volatility value (no greeks), but does have a KO limit where the whole contract is void if the underlying ever once crosses that point.

&gt; For example, a KO warrant on the S&amp;P 500 index with a KO limit of 4400 would be worth around $1 at the moment because the index is at around 4500. If it rises to 4600, the warrant is worth around $2, doubling the investment while the underlying moves 2.22% (note that this is linear because basically 4400 is the new 0 and the stock is now 200 instead of 100. An 11.11% rise in S&amp;P500 to 5000 would mean 500% profit with this specific contract (600 up from 4400).), while if it dipped to 4399 = game over.)

Seeing as you trade one kind of risk (Time decay / No volatility) for another (KO), but the profit potential is much higher than with regular calls (if going for a KO limit close to the current price, not otherwise but then it becomes pretty safe instead), I'm fairly intrigued and will try it out soon.

**Synopsis**

As Bitcoin creates waves, our team steps back to examine the origins of the cryptocurrency. Read our whitepaper to gain an in-depth understanding of the technology and it’s applicability.

In the last 10 years, concepts like blockchain and digital currencies have moved from small online communities to being supported by some of the world’s largest firms. These concepts and ideas were best presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in the creation of Bitcoin. With the rise in popularity, and the different offerings, MNP found it necessary to investigate what Bitcoin implementation best fits Nakamoto’s original vision.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” sets the stage for our analysis. Nakamoto’s whitepaper, emails, forum posts, and original source code define the protocol — the rule set for Bitcoin as a data network — and the key elements that make Bitcoin a functional technology. Along with the whitepaper, we reviewed the publicly available emails, forum posts, and original code left by Nakamoto. We used these source materials to determine what Nakamoto’s original purpose for Bitcoin was – a global electronic cash system (that works peer-to-peer), while also laying the foundation for a network that can support more advanced data applications.

Using the sources mentioned above, we developed an assessment framework and related criteria assessing the relevance of the Bitcoin scripting language (including OpCodes incorporated in it), protocol elements, and capabilities in current implementations — Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Core (BTC) against Nakamoto’s original vision.

Our findings indicate that BSV is most representative of Nakamoto’s original intention and design for Bitcoin. One key factor is because the BSV blockchain demonstrates the ability to scale to support significant volumes of transactions in a timely manner for macro-payments and even micropayments, resulting from BSV’s “Genesis” hard fork in February 2020. This removed any arbitrary cap on block size and allows the BSV blockchain and transaction capacity to grow unbounded, while also removing state restrictions limits and improving the code base to allow for unbounded scaling. In addition, the Genesis hard fork restored key aspects of the original functionality of Bitcoin script, the programming language used within the Bitcoin protocol. In our whitepaper, we also identify what technology capabilities can be enabled once Nakamoto’s vision for Bitcoin has been fully realized.

A general outline of report is as follows:

* The Bitcoin Whitepaper
* Nakamoto’s known Forum Posts, Emails
* The Original Bitcoin Protocol
   * Capabilities
   * Critical components
   * Non-functional requirements
   * Implementation attributes
* Comparison of current Bitcoin implementations to Nakamoto’s original vision
* Impact of Nakamoto’s vision once fully realized.

On TDA you can assign any sale of stock to a specific purchase in the past. This enables one to manage which shares you are selling at any given time, as opposed to having the FIFO method execute your trade by default. First in first out (for those unaware). There are other methods such as LIFO (last in last out), High cost first out, low cost first out, etc....

I have been averaging into Draftkings as a long term position, but have found that I also enjoy swing trading the stock due to the fact that I have been holding it and have become rather familiar with its movements/patterns. I purchased a few extra shares back in May around $42-$43 for the sake of reselling sometime in the near future around 60. The plan worked as expected and I sold a handful of shares yesterday for around 63.50...TDA requires the user to log in the following day to adjust the tax lot method or to assign a sale to a specific purchase. The stock does not settle for a couple days and this can be done anytime prior to settlement after the day the stock was sold. So...With that being said. This is my question...I notice I have shares from back in March of this year as well with a higher average of around $60. I have my other shares from May and they have an average of $43. My main position was purchased awhile ago (last year), and is averaged around 50 with shares purchased all over the place. I guess I am wondering if it would be wise to sell the shares purchased at $60 back in March instead - I would barely be breaking even on them, locking in next to no profit, but would inadvertently lower my cost basis and would leave the profit I could have taken on the table. This is all for the sake of having those shares for 1+ years and being able to hold them comfortably without having to risk losing any of my initial investment/capital...Or would it be wiser to take the profit I can take off of the shares purchased in May at $40 and simply keep the others until the cost rises. I guess I feel like delaying the profit taking until the shares have matured in my portfolio for a year or more would be wise so I am not paying as much tax? If i take profit now I pay the tax on it. If I sell my higher cost shares and just barely break even (nothing to pay tax on here). This enables me to sell the other shares with a lower cost basis (and therefor a higher likelihood of being profitable) later on without having to be taxed on the profit.

See the section titled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and the reconciliation tables below for important information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used by Coupa.

Business Outlook:

The following forward-looking statements reflect Coupa's expectations as of September 7, 2021.

Third quarter of fiscal 2022:

Total revenues are expected to be $177.0 to $178.0 million.
Subscription revenues are expected to be $158.0 to $159.0 million.
Professional services and other revenues are expected to be approximately $19.0 million.
Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be $6.0 to $7.0 million.
Non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated is expected to be $0.01 to $0.03 per share.
Diluted weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 77.0 million shares.
Full year fiscal 2­­022:

Total revenues are expected to be $706.0 to $708.0 million.
Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be $40.0 to $41.0 million.
Non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated is expected to be $0.27 to $0.29 per share.
Diluted weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 76.5 million shares.
Coupa has not reconciled its expectations for non-GAAP income from operations to GAAP loss from operations, or non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated to GAAP net loss per share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated because certain items excluded from non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Coupa Software Incorporated, such as charges related to stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, gain or loss on conversion of convertible senior notes, the adjustment attributable to non-controlling interests, and related tax effects, including non-recurring income tax adjustments, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. In addition, the effect of the anti-dilutive impact of the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the company's offerings of convertible notes in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. The effect of these items may be significant.

Or would there be the possibility that the newer fund gains popularity and demand, increasing the price above an even ratio of growth for that type of fund? Also besides gains that would incur in the sale of the one fund.|0.27|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]

t3_pjdlg3|1630980145.0|investing|After Covid-19: Former Google Taiwan Director Foresees Super-Unicorn Startups|"Misha Lu @ techtaiwan.com

As COVID-19 wreaked havoc across the globe, putting countless businesses on the brink of collapse, it has also given birth to new business opportunities oriented to remote working. In fact, the pandemic-driven “Work-From-Home” economy has led to a growing number of unicorns – startups with valuations above $1 billion. According to CB Insights, in the first half of 2021 alone, 203 unicorns have emerged worldwide. 

As the total number of these unicorns has tipped to above 700 around the world, Taiwan is mooted to be one of those locations with a high potential to pump out world-class unicorns. Speaking at Connect 2021 (Link in Chinese), a leading Taiwanese tech forum co-organized by TechTaiwan, Google Taiwan’s former director Dr. Lee-Feng Chien offered his insight on Taiwan’s startup and investment environment, outlining the challenges faced by Taiwanese startups and the country’s significance to the global investment community. 

“Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy.”

At the moment, Taiwan already has three unicorns. The most prominent among them is Gogoro, a leading e-bike manufacturer that has been expanding its presence in the US, Europe and India. Another unicorn is 91APP, a software company that facilitates small merchants to launch e-commerce apps. The third unicorn, Appier, is an AI software company founded in 2012, counting among its investors SoftBank Group and Temasek Holding, and has recently gone public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raising  US$130 million. In fact, Appier is the first Taiwanese company to be listed in Japan since 1998.

“The success of 91APP signifies that Taiwan’s capital market has started paying attention to digital economy, willing to give it a higher valuation,” observed Chien who, in his time as Google Taiwan’s director, oversaw its foundation from scratch, and eventually made it Google’s largest hardware R&amp;amp;amp;D hub outside of the US. By introducing three data centers, Google also laid the foundation of Taiwan’s data economy. 

“Appier’s listing means that Taiwanese startups have the capability to make it abroad,” Chien commented, expressing his optimism toward Taiwanese startup scene’s recent developments. According to the Google veteran, if more startups can expand beyond Taiwan as Appier has done before, it will be a boost to Taiwan’s digital economy. Constrained by the size of real economy though, startups in the digital economy sector have so far accounted little in Taiwan’s GDP. 

The rise of super-unicorn startups

The wave of digital transformation ushered in by the pandemic, however, is regarded by Chien as the opportunity of the decade for Taiwanese startups. He noted that COVID-19 altered the traditionally conservative investment strategy of private equity funds. As investment returns dropped, private equity funds have increasingly moved into venture capital investments. 

This latest development is simultaneously a challenge and a chance to Taiwan’s startup landscape: while it pushes unicorn startups to the forefront of post-pandemic global economic revival by funnelling in the surplus in the capital market, creating so-called “super-unicorns” valued above US$10 billion in the process, it also diverts investments away from early-stage startups. 

“It is the best time to fundraise for startups, but not necessarily for launching them,” Chien observed. Under these circumstances, he pointed out that in addition to the home market, Taiwanese startups would have to secure at least one overseas market , just like Appier did, to attract the global capital market. The internet-based digital world, he observed, could lower the threshold with its borderless nature, and Chien considered it a must for Taiwanese unicorns to engage with this platform to expand its horizon. 

However, Chien also set his sight beyond digital economy, considering its growth peak to be over and competition already too fierce. Instead, he identified space, especially the satellite industry, to be the likelier sectors from which the next unicorns will emerge."|0.67|20.0|0.0|20.0|['Appier', 'Google', 'SoftBank Group', 'Gogoro', 'Google Taiwan’s', 'Google Taiwan', 'CB Insights', 'Connect', 'TechTaiwan\n\n', '91APP', 'the Tokyo Stock Exchange', 'TechTaiwan', 'Temasek Holding', '91APP,']

There was a lot of uncertainty whether China is shutting itself off from foreign capital and how it could lead to delisting of ADRs like BABA, BIDU, JD, PDD, NIO, etc. But I guess they won't be turning their heads away from foreign investors anytime soon.**

BEIJING, Sept 6 (Reuters) - China will further open its capital markets to foreign investors, the country's top securities regulator said on Monday, adding that it will pursue pragmatic cross-border cooperation to regulate overseas-listed Chinese companies.

Global investors have been spooked in recent months by a flurry of Chinese regulations targeting sectors ranging from technology to private tutoring. U.S. plans to kick non-compliant Chinese firms off American exchanges has fuelled concern.

""Opening-up and cooperation is the inevitable trend in the integrated development of global capital markets,"" China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman told a conference organised by the World Federation of Exchanges.

China is studying further measures, including expanding the scope of the stock connect scheme linking China and Hong Kong and improving the Shanghai-London Stock Connect program, Yi said in a speech posted on CSRC's website.

Meanwhile, CSRC will conduct ""pragmatic"" cooperation in areas such as supervision of overseas-listed Chinese companies, cross-border auditing and law enforcement, he added.

Yi said that given interwoven global markets, governments should abandon the mentality of a ""zero-sum game"", as companies and investors share both the boom and the doom.

Global financial centres should facilitate cross-border financing, ""rather than become the platforms and tools governments use to sanction other countries"", Yi said, without mentioning the United States.

Yi's speech came a day after CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai made similar pledges to further deregulate China's markets.

China will expand the channels for foreign capital to invest in Chinese securities and futures markets, and will further facilitate the issuance of yuan-denominated ""Panda bonds"" by foreign institutions, Fang told a separate conference on Sunday.

China will also improve domestic listing rules for overseas entities, as well as regulations on overseas listings of Chinese companies, Fang said in a speech also posted on CSRC's website.

Fang also vowed to safeguard Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre, saying that Beijing supports domestic companies listing in Hong Kong.

I have recently been interested in Morningstar’s ETF rating system which has been a popular tool used for ranking ETFs and i wanted to do an experiment or judging of sorts on this system because picking the correct ETF for long term investing and sustainability is extremely important especially with compounded growth, dividend reinvestment, and the fact that most people can not the spend the time I did and usually can just spend a little time looking at articles or have to listen to financial advisors for ETF recommendation which may not always be the best idea considering not all of your financial advisors incentives are/will be aligned with yours. I have personal experience with this considering my father who has cash that needs to be invested in his 401k and also my grandparents which are aiming for sustainability in their portfolio allowing for them not to worry too much about their withdrawal percentage each year.


To start it off, You are able to check on Morningstar to see all of their 5 star ratings on ETFs which have varying risk return ratios

I have done the arduous task of narrowing down and categorizing these ETFs in their sector both identified by Morningstar and by different preferences.

In my first wave of narrowing, I searched up each ETF and looked at the 5 year price history, other analyst rating available besides Morningstar, dividend yields (relative to expectation and ETF type), Morningstar risk/return ratings, and long term sector/industry outlook for the respective ETFs.

From the about 140 5-star ETFs rated by Morningstar, only 91 remain from the previous criteria mentioned.

I then categorized the remaining 91 ETFs into their categories for comparison between sector ETFs to find which are the best picks:

	From this categorization we can see that the out of my narrowed down 91 ETFs from the original 140ish, it is a very well diversified portfolio of ETFs and represent many sectors in the global economy except for the energy sector which, besides new and renewable energy industries, isn’t poised for growth in the long term.

I may do a second part to this where analyze each ETF in each industry or in each ETF type more thoroughly especially for the categories labeled “(broad)” and may give my own rating on ETFs I find interesting since some of the large cap, dividend, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P are doing strategies such as futures contracts or covered calls which differ from the standard equity etf found in these sectors.

After this second part I will or someone would If they like to create a final comparison between the final narrowed down portfolio and the benchmark category I created.

I have approximately $28k across about a dozen stocks at the moment.  All pay at least a 3% dividend and IMO have limited downside in the long term.  Dividends pay me about $1375 per year at this point.  

My thought process is, these dividend payments will keep money flowing into my brokerage account and allow me to keep reinforcing my existing positions and opening new ones without having to sell off any positions.

Today my margin buying power is at a negative -$ 8,000 and non margin at a negative -$2,400. It’s clear that my cash buying power was used because I have $2,400 left to withdraw from the account. So why does the system spazz out even though I didn’t even use margin for the purchase and have over $20,000 equity in the account. I understand the stock is volatile but it doesn’t make sense to me especially since I used non-margin buying power for the trade. Thank you!

Resolution: I spoke to Fidelity and they said nothing was wrong with the trade and everything looks good. Some of the processing times didn't line up and it triggered a house call. They said on rare occasions the cash might take a longer to settle from an EFT even if it shows up in your account under non-margin buying power. Due to the holiday weekend there was a delay in processing and everything should clear up by tomorrow morning. They even offered to make a trade on my behalf if needed until it clears."|0.75|13.0|0.0|13.0|['Fidelity']

Off the top of my head :

1) Buying deep ITM calls (eg buy a SPY 250 call, it costs approx half of SPY and returns the same dollar change but a larger percentage)

Downsides : often high cost of leverage (like 5% premium to asset value), limited time horizon - if you bought march 2020 spy 250 calls for leverage a year prior you may have lost it all, while stock holders did not see any expiry

2) Buying levered instruments (3x daily etfs)

downsides : volatility drag, liable to blow up in a 2008 style crisis, expense ratio

3) Buying mutual funds or other funds that use leverage on your behalf (eg PSLDX) 

downsides : expense ratio, limited transparency for some, often illiquid and difficult to enter or exit on short time scales

4) Borrowing money (eg line of credit, refinance mortgage) to contribute to your tax advantaged account 

downsides : you can lose more than just your investments(bank can come for your assets), might be screwey with contribution limits to tax advantaged accounts

Are there any other methods i'm missing?  Thoughts on what the best way is? I feel like it's likely deep ITM options. Eg - SPY 150C for Dec 2023 costs ~$30k rn, gives you a notional position of 45k for a leverage ratio of 1.5x."|0.62|5.0|0.0|5.0|['ITM']

t3_phdpx5|1630702679.0|investing|Casino Stocks Are Sizzling After Fierce Covid Downturn|" 

When it comes down to sizing the global online gambling market, “all bets are on.” Grand View Research says it will grow 11.5% to $127.3 billion in 2020-2027, while The Business Research Company predicts an increase of 10.4% to $92.8 million in 2019-2023. With these estimates, gambling stocks –including those of online casinos– are roaring up.

## Online Gambling Growth

It was a tough last couple of years for brick-and-mortar casinos. The American Gaming Association reports that all commercial and tribal casino properties in the U.S. closed during Covid lockdowns, with tiers 1 and 6 operating between 24% and 50% capacity upon returning to operations. 

However, with this reactivation and the technological advances of online betting, the gambling industry is back with a bang and has become one of the fastest-growing businesses on the planet.

According to Insider Monkey, the online gambling market has reached 1.6 billion people, reigniting an industry that has seen a dramatic transformation through new technology. 

Play Today says that at least 80% of Americans gambled in the past year, as users rushed to online casino directories like Canada Casinos to crash the website, looking for some blazing betting fun.

During the pandemic, the business not only grew in size but also witnessed some eye-catching movements in online gambling stocks, with companies like DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) soaring after its 2020 IPO.

Also, “MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) launched its mobile betting app BetMGM in partnership with Roar Digital, LLC,” Insider Monkey Reports.

## Stocks On The Rise

This year, 12 states in the U.S. will legalize sports betting spreading the impact to online gambling platforms. With this outlook, the famous site Gambling.com going public under the “GAMB” ticker, with a price per share estimate of 8$ –although down from $11 to $13.

The company controls more than 30 websites in 13 countries, and hit nearly $28 million in revenue in 2020 and $11.5 million in the first quarter this year.

Another attractive stock option within the online gambling market is Penn National Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: PENN), which was mentioned in the second quarter investor letter of Baron Funds.

The letter said: “Following a 232% gain in 2020, the shares of Penn National Gaming, Inc. declined 29% in the most recent quarter and are down 13% year-to-date. At its recent price of only $73 (down from a peak price of $136 in March), we believe Penn’s shares are now attractively valued.”

The casino firm is based in Pennsylvania boasting an $11.1 billion market capitalization. “PENN delivered a -17.98% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 32.73%. The stock closed at $70.84 per share on August 13, 2021.”

## Brick-And-Mortar

Amid the economic comeback, brick-and-mortar casinos are also on the way up. According to Truist analyst Barry Jonas gave Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) a Hold rating “and increased its price target from $43 to $38.”

The vaccine rollout is likely to exert a positive effect on these stocks, coupled with the company’s solid earnings and optimistic forecast.

Insider Monkey reports that “In the first quarter of 2021, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) had an EPS of $0.68, short on estimates of $0.85. The company’s net revenue decreased 15.6% or $1.20 billion from the previous quarter.”

As for Caesars Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:CZR), the casino leader saw a solid EPS of $2.03 in the first quarter, up from $1.80. Its revenue during the same period hit $1.7 billion, an increase of 259.2% versus the last year. “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has gained 131% in the past 12 months and 27% year to date.”

I find that investing in quality foreign companies via ADRs can be a good way to generate alpha as there are fewer eyeballs on these sort of names. I typically only invest in ADRs with good liquidity as some trade fewer than 1k shares per day. That said, what are your favorites? I can give you a couple of mine: 

ADYEY (Adyen N.V.) - Major fintech/payment gateway, on the level of PayPal, Square, and Stripe. From what I've read, Adyen services large multinational companies (vs. Stripe which focuses more on startups). These companies have great business models with strong network effects and a long runway for growth. A lot of people know about PYPL/SQ/Stripe already and I think Adyen flies a bit under the radar in comparison. 

EVVTY (Evolution AB) - Supplier of live casino services, allowing customer-facing online casinos the ability to offer real-time gameplay. Maybe you have heard of some of these burgeoning online casinos; Roobet and Duelbits are just a couple of examples. Despite the capital-intensive nature of building a live casino (setting up studio, hiring dealers, server costs, etc.), Evolution is able to spread this cost over its customer base, providing a cheaper option than what customers would be able to develop in-house. The stock may suffer over the short term as in-person casinos reopen, but longer-term I see a significant opportunity for Evolution to dominate the live casino space (with +60% EBITDA margins to boot). 

So, what are you're favorite foreign companies/ADRs?

t3_phd21p|1630700457.0|investing|A Canadian trust is Likely Accelerating the World's Uranium Shortage.|"Edit:  I just want to note upfront, I'm not advocating you go out and buy Uranium miners or trust/futures etc.  My purpose is to share what I think is an interesting study in reflexivity / market behavior.     

There's something funky going on in the Uranium market. On the 17th of August, Uranium prices started climbing, and they've been climbing every day since.  Interestingly, nothing of note around nuclear power has come out since then.  Just rising Uranium prices and analyst upgrades for mining companies.  Feel free to correct me if you know otherwise.

For some background, there's been a perpetual shortage of Uranium production in the world. The total stockpile of uranium has been falling for over a decade straight.  

Coincidentally, the [Sprott Physical Uranium trust launched an at the market equity program on the 17th](https://sprott.com/investor-relations/press-releases/sprott-physical-uranium-trust-launches-at-the-market-equity-program/).  When premiums to NAV get too high, they sell more shares, which they are then obligated to spend any raised capital on acquiring uranium.   

I think that there shelf program is, literally, moving the market.  Uranium is a relatively small and illiquid market.  [Total annual uranium production is in the neighborhood of 130MM pounds.](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx)  Consumption is about 25% higher than that.  Sprott [lists](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/) their uranium stockpile on a daily basis.  As of Thursday the 2nd, they had 21.8MM pounds of Uranium.  Checking the Wayback machine, they had 19.8MM on Wednesday the 25th.  That's an increase of 2 Million pounds in 8 days, or 250,000 lbs per day.  Daily global production is only ~375,000 lbs.  **Sprott's trust has bought 67% of global uranium production over the last week**.  Volumes are accelerating, and it's possible their buying rate will increase going forward.  

I think we could be witnessing the beginnings of a  reflexive process here.  Higher uranium prices will attract more speculators, pouring more capital into the speculative acquisition of uranium needed by utilities, further driving up prices.  

TLDR:  The Sprott Uranium Trust has bought 75% worth of the world's Uranium production over the last week, and judging by the volume, it's accelerating.

You may not believe things will go down, and if so it’s not my intention to argue — I’m familiar enough with investing to know value stocks will win if held in the long run and I understand we’re in the greatest bill run in history BUT I can’t help but see breaks in the dam. I’m looking to make money when things go down. 

Mostly concerned with:

1. Exorbitant P/E ratios fueled by aggressive buybacks — inflates stock price without adding any tangible assets to companies 
2. Powell had no room to lower rates, we’re at the bottom, when we go up it will massively affect business lending and many low-margin businesses won’t be able to stay around without massive price increases 
3. Inflation isn’t transitory. Now that money velocity is returning to pre-pandemic levels we are seeing inflation everywhere. It’s not just cars. Unless there’s more lockdowns you restrict spending, you can calculate CPI anyway you want and it will continue to climb 
4. The reverse repo market is super sketchy and more banks are participating

You may not agree with any of this and believe the bull market will continue forever, but I believe we’re back in the pickle faced by Carter and will need to boost interest rates to combat inflation at which point a great majority of small companies will fold — and largely inflated P/E ratios will fall resulting in a catastrophic loss of market cap on Wall Street.

Companies that have generated high ESG scores  (when analyzed right) have proven to outperform other companies in their sector **over the long term.**

ESG analysis is thorough and when done right is not surface level. The high ESG is essentially a scoring that communicates a company's ability to be more sustainable, environmentally friendly and operate in a more work place friendly culture and so these companies tended to weather economic storms (so to speak) better than their counterparts. **Over the long term**.

Therefore,  the financial incentive is that a high ESG score is associated with decreasing cost of capital. Why? They are deemed to be a less riskier asset class. They may not generate absolute return returns but they are stable and steadily increasing.

So we have ESG Funds popping up, and Asset management firms are hiring ESG Analysts - Governing bodies and other public entities as well etc. etc.

So why do so many consider ESG ""a scam"" or ""woke"" investing? Is it because it introduces a class system in the public equity space that they consider themselves to be lesser in?"|0.55|7.0|0.0|7.0|['ESG']

I have shared write-ups on this specific stock many times on other subreddits, My initial position was taken back in April, with many purchases since then.

Edited down from a **SeekingAlpha** article for brevity's sake. Full article is very detailed and a recommend to read fully.

**Short term Risks:**

HC Approval. In the short term, it’s all that matters effectively. This company has many opportunities not discussed here, so the long term view is quite bright. In other words, the face mask and PPE market opportunity is a launch pad for the even larger opportunities that will come later. Thus, if HC approval does not come through-

(more questions that delay things beyond, let’s say a month or 2, or worse, an outright rejection – neither of which is expected, but can't be known with regulators until it becomes public, which is why getting approval is a MAJOR de-risking event for the company)

\-then expect the stock to have a rough time of it. On the other hand, if they get approval... This company is in what Stan Druckenmiller has described as “Inning 1.” If for some reason, HC does not grant approval and bless it as anti-viral and biocidal, but leaves the door open, then the stock steps back and it will be Stan’s Inning 0, as long as HC ultimately grants approval.

**Investment Thesis:**

***ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.*** **(OTCPK:ZENYF) (ZEN.V)** has a major catalyst ahead of it with the decision of Health Canada as to the safety and efficacy of its game-changing biocidal, anti-viral and anti-microbial AgGO-2 mask coating.

Risks are in favor of approval, which would be a major de-risking event, causing a rapid and significant (roughly 100%+) re-rating of the stock. For those less inclined to await approval, the intermediate and longer term upside would remain significant, even from those levels, giving a pre-approval *risky* investment or a significantly less risky post-approval investment.

The business model is extraordinary (discussed below), so if the company executes anywhere near plan, this will be a hyper-growth company that will be a ""must own"" over the next few years as the Graphene industry develops.

The company has a graphite deposit which is at the development stage, which costs very little to maintain for now and which won’t be mined for many years, if ever. I expect de minimis expenses for the deposit for the foreseeable future.

**Three Initial Target Markets:**

*Prevention, Detection and Treatment*

1. Personal Protective Equipment (""PPE,"" e.g., masks, gowns, caps, booties, nitrile gloves (hospitals and restaurants, etc.) and Air Filtration (e.g., HVAC filters),
2. Detection/Sensors (e.g., game-changing rapid, inexpensive and high accuracy COVID testing, with other tests behind that, such as STDs (a huge and rapidly growing problem), certain types of cancer and other diseases/viruses) and
3. Therapeutics - both topical and ingested, but that's longer term in nature due to regulatory hurdles and could be tremendous, but let’s leave that for another time. In addition, there are many other potential applications, such as fuel additives to improve efficiency, paints to reduce ice on plane wings, and countless other applications.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**

ZEN’s first market will be the application of its formula to surgical and other masks. The effect of their formula is innovative and game-changing: it is to be applied on an additional layer of mask, which essentially grabs the particle (the formula is hydrophilic) when it hits the mask (either coming at the wearer or from the wearer) and then render it harmless.

The next PPE application will be for nitrile gloves. Given the tremendous threat posed by MERSA, alone, it seems logical that the company’s customers ultimately also will apply ZEN’s formula to surgical caps, gowns and booties.

**Air Filtration, Air Conditioning Filters:**

This is an enormous market, with various industry reports reporting it in the many billions of dollars. That’s when things are “normal” (i.e., pre-COVID). If the mask market is a company-maker, the A/C filtration market is a barn burner. There are millions of office buildings in the US and Canada.

There are over 6,000 hospitals.

There are over 21,000 nursing homes and elder care facilities.

There are airports, airplanes, trains, subways, restaurants, theaters, malls - all are high traffic, often densely packed and require the best quality filters on the market.

And all are desperate for solutions to create a safe environment to bring back business.

**Detection and Sensors:**

The company’s product (separate from the AgO-2 solution) provides next generation rapid, saliva-based antigen detection. In about 8 minutes and at very low cost per test, according to the company, the product uses a patent-pending DNA aptamer that recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein simply through a saliva test.

Imagine going to an indoor concert today with 1000s of other people packed in in close proximity and no masks? What if for something like a $10 ticket surcharge, you could arrive at a pre-assigned time (let's say an extra 10-30 min early, depending on the size of the venue and number of entrances), get tested, have a highly accurate answer in 8 min, and then go in to the concert, free of concerns that the 100s of people anywhere near you and the 1000s in the auditorium have COVID.

Please see the company’s presentation for more details: [ZEN Graphene Solutions](https://www.zengraphene.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021_08ZEN-Investor-Presentation.pdf). The solution appears to be scalable, accurate (making PCR tests look awful) and has the added benefit that aptamers can be adapted to be used for many diseases, well beyond COVID. It's a tremendous market opportunity for the company that cracks this nut and also a very high margin business.

**Therapeutics:**

Down the road, the company is looking to enter the therapeutics market, including both topical and ingested applications. Management believes this market opportunity may be even larger than the aforementioned markets. As these take time to enter and will not drive revenue in the near-term, but also won’t cost much to pursue in the short term, I’ll address them at a later time.

**The Model:**

The company has initiated a pilot line and is producing roughly 1 million masks per day (1M mpd). The company is also building out a 25M mpd facility nearby their offices that is scheduled to begin ramping production in Nov. The same coating should be applied to many different use cases, so the company thinks about sales in “masks equivalent” (“me”). For instance, if a typical industrial air filter is 3m x 3m (my slightly educated guess), that would require roughly 100me.

**Margins:**

Assuming GM north of 80%, given that graphite (the underlying commodity) is cheap and plentiful, we’re talking about a nano-material, so very small quantities are required relative to output and revenue.

**OP's Note:** They are currently purchasing Graphene-oxide from a third-party to fullfill production, but anticipate a scaling-up of in-house production over the next year. Price of purchase is proprietary according to Exec. Dir. but claim that their studies of the material they are purchasing fit the bill for the mask-coatings.

**Expenses:**

Expect the company to be running at about $300K per month in opex, which already allows for running the new facility since most of it is automated machinery. Per [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiNxl9nMuZ4) Aug. 11th, opex was $200K/month, but given what the Chairman recently said on a public [investor](https://zoom.us/rec/play/o0pa1AWvr7JeqA8NB9eYv-msGZT6lyORYdfPNtQv0WsGV_xBAQeWx9kktlZAAW3_atTsk3TGZEAB3q1J.f6gqjOS0h0D6ZxTw?continueMode=true&amp;tk=BC-G9Hc3b6WfHM3UmFy3BtwyvR54zN_0CLWXDs2uJ94.DQMAAAAWnR6e9RZvMncxdTZNNVJwbVBlNDBFNUlkV1Z3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&amp;uuid=WN_Mt_sG54lRg2JoK-vzA8ctA&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=LzQDuI2dSS2ES6R-FeKTXQ.1629297669865.7b102740d4e41e5d6637da3088f7c22a&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=39) call, they’re hiring at least a few heads.

For the sake of conservatism, assume that given the massive ramp in revenue and profitability, they’ll end up spending more than that, so double their current opex number to $400K.

**Capex:**

Assume capex will be around $5M-ish, a good bit of which already has been spent. Regardless, the number is so low as to be inconsequential if the company is generating the kind of cash flow, it will, given their current cash position of something just over $4M plus a bit more than that amount in warrants, many of which are in the money and some of which have acceleration clauses; roughly $8M-ish+, all in, vs a very low burn rate.

Obviously, since they’re only beginning to ramp and generate revenue, there is a wide range of profit possibilities. Based on what co has said: Assuming the company makes something toward 4c/mask, based on what would be a conservative assumption, which is using the lower end of the midpoint of the revenue per mask the company mentions in its presentation, which you can review, as noted, above.

Let’s say that at some point in 1H:2022 they’re selling out the 25M mpd. That’s:

25M mpd equivalent x .04 = $1M/day in revenue

x 80%+ GM = $800K/day GP (all numbers in Canadian Dollars)

x 30 days/mo = $24M/mo GP -$400K/mo opex (using low end of what management has said)

= $23.6M EBITDA per month x 12 months = $283.2M EBITDA / year -27% tax rate = $206.7M in Net Income /99M shares (fully diluted) = C$2.09 annualized run rate EPS (approx. $1.66 in USD)

(the company has a $30M NOL that will reduce this on first earnings)

**Balance Sheet:**

With $4M in cash and more than that in in-the-money warrants, some of which have accelerator clauses, the Company doesn’t need capital. Assuming they get HC approval, are generating meaningful rev and cash flow and want to improve the company’s public profile, I could definitely see this Street-savvy management team raising capital opportunistically.

I’m okay with that: a company that doesn’t need to raise money won’t be forced to do so at unattractive prices, like so many small cap companies. A company growing rapidly with their business accelerating and a long runway will have investors clamoring to get in at scale, so deal terms should be very attractive for all parties involved. Since they don’t need money, they can be opportunistic about whether and at what price they might consider a deal.

If they continue to hit milestones, any such deal would only be done at multiples of the current price. (Yes, I know that sounds like every other small cap dream, but if you dig into this one, you’ll see it’s quite rational.) Anticipate that the company will seek uplisting on the US markets later this year if Sep 27th shareholder vote passes through.

**Misc:**

Lock-up expiration behind us: There was a deal in the spring. The lock up expiration is now well behind us (early Aug).

**Insider Buying:**

The CEO recently bought 50,000 shares (over $100,000) in the open market. He's already the largest shareholder, owning about 4% of the company. I see this as a vote of confidence in ZEN's prospects of winning HC approval.

**Summary:**

* ZEN is an IP play with a strong management team and an outstanding business model and is creating game-changing “must have” products, rather than “nice to have” ones.
* ZEN makes an innovative, proprietary, patent pending silver graphene oxide (AgGO-2) formulation at the nano-scale that will be applied to various materials for many applications.
* Revenues should start very soon, incremental margins should be very attractive and the company should be profitable and CF+ imminently, *possibly* earning their market cap within a year.
* If things play out according to base case, the stock should trade at a minimum of C$40+ within 12-24 months, returning well over 10x.
* ZEN potentially has a very long and steep growth trajectory that could last a very long time. This is the best idea I've seen in years."|0.63|7.0|0.0|7.0|['Zen.v', 'OP', 'Inning 1', 'Stan’s Inning 0', 'co', 'ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.', '**SeekingAlpha**', 'ZEN', 'Health Canada', 'HC']

#### Now, a few words on the criteria I’m using and sources of data.

**1. TheStreet score**

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I’m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *– The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication — not a guarantee — we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):

*TheStreet Ratings’ stock model projects a stock’s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

**2. Zacks Rank**

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we’re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company’s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500’s +10.6% .*

**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**

We’re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:

*“A” Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a “****Strong Buy****“.*

*“B” rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a “****Buy****“.*

**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**

It is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

**5. Piotroski F-Score**

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company’s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.

**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

&gt;Evergrande has warned it risks defaulting on its debt if it fails to raise cash, as China’s most heavily indebted property developer battles to stave off an unfolding liquidity crisis.  The unusually stark wording from the company came in an interim earnings statement on Tuesday that confirmed a profit warning issued last week and outlined a series of measures to shore up its finances that include selling properties.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The group has risks of defaults on borrowings and cases of litigation outside of its normal course of business,” Evergrande said, adding that it would pursue further asset sales, control costs and seek to attract new investors.  The warning comes as Evergrande experiences the worst upheaval in its history, with a stream of recent problems raising questions over its access to financing, forcing it to sell assets and earning it an unusual public rebuke from the government over its debt risks....

For those not aware, Evergrande is the largest real estate developer in the world. And it's arguably the largest real estate developer in the largest real estate bubble in the world.

I'm sharing this because ***if*** this were to default, it could be a trigger for some much larger market turmoil. Evergrande represents potential systemic risk both in China as well as the global financial markets. IE, this defaulting ***could*** be a bit of a Lehman-esque type moment.

With that out of the way, I want to be very clear - **\*\*this is NOT likely to default\*\*** since the strong likelihood is that it will get a bailout due to the system wide risk attached to it for China. Edit: and also just to add, China controls a lot of levers in their economy that you would not see in western free markets. This can potentially prevent things from spiraling in a negative manner.

With that being said, history has a lot of examples of policy mistakes, or attempts to control asset bubbles that simply end up popping the bubble. I stated this a few months ago, but the current attempt from Chinese policymakers to control debt and reduce economic risk is a tightrope walk, and there are legitimate risks of overtightening. With that said, China has a LOT of control over all the levers in their financial system, so if any country would be able to stop a cascade, it's likely China.

The result is that this is more likely to be a bottom for Chinese markets assuming it gets a bailout. But there is a small tail chance that the complete opposite happens and things really fall apart. Since that chance is larger than normal (but still not large) and the magnitude of effects are enormous if it were to occur, it's something that's worth at least being aware of.

**Note:** Please at least try to refrain from making this into an ideological or political debate about China.  Given, sometimes these things merge into the financial realm of discussion, but at least try to take a neutral view of this."|0.94|525.0|0.0|525.0|['Evergrande']

I have tried importing stock information to Excel myself, unfortunately the method I'm using leaves out EPS (a metric I consider to be one of the most valuable measures in determining investment decision).

Does anyone know of a location on the internet to acquire big data on the SNP 500 that can be sorted similar to that of a chart in Excel?

I love love love cybersecurity stocks, think they are in an underdeveloped sector that has plenty of challenges that will be addressed by many of the stocks like CRWD, FTNT, PANW, etc in the future

HOWEVER

I am most concerned out of any sector of stocks in the cybersecurity space when tapering begins or starts to become a real issue (in maybe 4-6 months?). To me, these stocks which are both tech and growth in a space that is still so under defined is going to suffer the most from taper more than tech names that have proven reliable for years and years, and bc the sector has easily done the best out of any ""growth"" stock in the past year or so. The problem is they are both speculative and successful stocks this year which means the most likely culprit for profit taking in comparison to FAANG stocks which the average trader still tries to hold onto for their entire life. 

What do people make of this? As much as I'd love to go totally all in on them ASAP, with tapering at some point going to rear it's ugly head probably in a few months, I'm not quite sure."|0.49|0.0|0.0|0.0|['FAANG', 'FTNT', 'CRWD', 'PANW']

The section titled ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below contains a description of the non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP information are contained in the tables below.

Financial Outlook:

Okta's financial outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022 includes the expected contribution from the acquisition of Auth0, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The acquisition closed on May 3, 2021.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company expects:

Total revenue of $325 million to $327 million, representing a growth rate of 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $35 million to $34 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.25 to $0.24, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 153 million.

For the full year fiscal 2022, the Company now expects:

Total revenue of $1.243 billion to $1.250 billion, representing a growth rate of 49% to 50% year-over-year;

Non-GAAP operating loss of $119 million to $114 million; and

Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.77 to $0.74, assuming weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 147 million.

These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to the Forward-Looking Statements safe harbor below for information on the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

Okta has not reconciled its expectations as to non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of Okta’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP net loss per share are not available without unreasonable effort.

Conference Call Information:

Okta will host a live video webcast at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on September 1, 2021 to discuss the results and outlook. The news release with the financial results will be accessible from the Company’s website at investor.okta.com prior to the conference call. The live video webcast of the conference call will be accessible from the Okta investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Supplemental Financial and Other Information:

Supplemental financial and other information can be accessed through the Company’s investor relations website at investor.okta.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, current calculated billings and calculated billings. Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.

Okta believes that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by the Company's management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP.

Okta encourages investors to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business."|0.85|60.0|0.0|60.0|['Nasdaq', 'GAAP', 'OKTA', 'Okta', '-Okta, Inc.', 'Auth0']

Lots of insider buying, both of stock and warrants.

I have two more days to go, and most Fridays stocks go into the red to burn options holders.

My gambling question is this:

Do you cash out at 10% or do you 'let it ride' if you have a few days to go? It would seem if I always cashed out winning options at 10% I probably would have more wins, but also potentially leave cash on the table.

I check in a few times a month, sometimes less. I bought some TLND many years ago. I was checking the price recently, and noticed a very strange jump and plateau. I found out it was because it was in the process of getting acquired for a set price, and thus it plateaued at that price.

Naturally I went looking in my account to see how it did, and I can't find it.  As I understand it, an acquired company stock turns into the stock of the acquiring company. That symbol is TBA, and I don't see it anywhere.

Anyone have any insight what happened to it?


Also, I can't exactly ask my bank, since I have 3, and I forgot exactly which one it was. I guess I could ask all three....

**Data**

Data consists of (financial related) headlines, tweets, chatter that is collected over time. This is a fairly large dataset (about 2 gb) that is updated daily.

**Methodology**

Ive trained Neural Networks (Machine Learning) to recognize topics, emotions, sentiment etc in snippets of texts (headlines, tweets etc etc). Each snippet of text in the database gets assigned a score by being processed through these models. From here these scores are converted in to time series in order to see how emotions, narratives or sentiment evolves over time

t3_pfgwru|1630450492.0|investing|U308 POWER TO THE PEOPLE! Uranium dd|"I think discussions around uranium investments are sorely missing from this forum. There are a lot of people on the r/UraniumSqueeze subreddit who knows this field much better than I do but this is my attempt at a short dd.

You probably have heard of the ""uraniumsqueeze"" hypothesis, maybe you laughed about it and thought, ""yeah right, uranium is just for the boomers that don't understand my precious safemoon/BTC/GME/TSLA/AMZN/APPL investments"".

 The bull thesis on uranium equities is simple: **extreme supply and demand dislocations**. Uranium production has not kept up with consumption for years. How is this possible and why did it happen? 

Current low price. After the last uranium bubble in 2007, when uranium reached $140/lb prices, uranium prices have been depressed and hovering around $27-30/lb. There are several reasons for this: 1, Fukushima and the associated reduced popularity of nuclear power; 2, oversupply of cheap uranium from nuclear weapons stockpiles during years of disarmament, this is not happening anymore and the stockpiles from this period are running low. **The current price of uranium is lower than the cost of producing in most mines.** The mines that can produce at or below the current price can not supply nearly enough to satisfy the demand of the nuclear power plants.

Supply issues. 1, The low uranium prices has caused most uranium producers to reduce or entirely stop production, this includes the two largest producers in the world, Kazatomprom has reduced their production by 20% until 2023 ([https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Kazatomprom-extends-uranium-production-cuts-into-2)), Cameco has kept their McArthur mine closed since 2018 (this is the largest high-grade uranium deposit in the world). Starting up a mine that has been closed for years can take a long time (many months, maybe more than a year). **Most of the uranium mining companies that you will find on the stock market are not producing at all due to the current low price or uranium!** They know that uranium price have to rise and they can't afford to produce at the current price. Many companies will not even consider production until uranium reaches \~$65/lb; 2, covid caused further reductions in uranium production; 3, Due to the decade long uranium slump since Fukushima there are very few companies in the sector, 30-40 companies are involved in uranium mining, a resource responsible for 10% of the worlds electricity generation!

Demand. 1, 10% of global electricity comes from ~440 nuclear powerplants, these powerplants need a reliable supply of uranium. Uranium is a minimal part of the cost of running a nuclear reactor, to the plant operators it does not matter that much if the uranium costs $30/lb or $100/lb; 2, Despite all the naysayers who think nuclear is dying, the demand for uranium is expected to increase for the foreseeable future. ~50 new nuclear plants are planned or under construction. Old reactors that were supposed to retire are having their lives extended. Many countries will not be able to reach their CO2 reduction goals without nuclear power; 3, due to the low price of uranium a lot of the former uranium producers are now buying uranium on the spot market and stockpiling it, they know that the current prices are a bargain and that they have to go up. 4, the US is establishing a uranium strategic reserve and plan to start buying up a total of $1.5-billion of uranium. 5, **Maybe the most important factor is the Sprott Uranium Trust that entered the market two weeks ago**. The Sprott trust was created to capitalize on the current situation, they plan to buy and hold uranium until the prices are significantly higher. Since they entered the market 2 weeks ago the uranium spot price has steadily risen by &gt;10% and just reached its five-year high today ($34.63). Mind you, this is still very low.

Why should you care? The combination of supply and demand issues will cause the uranium price to rise. It just reached a 5-year high and I would be surprised if it does not reach $40/lb by the end of the year, it is reasonable to expect it to reach $65/lb in the next two years. 

So, a doubling of the uranium price in a couple of years, what's the big deal you might say? Maybe you think your favorite investment is likely to more than double in two years?

Well, turns out that most of the uranium companies (producers/developers/explorers) are heavily leveraged to the uranium price. If the uranium price doubles, most of the companies in the uranium sector are likely to much more than double, by how much depends on the company. In addition, many of the uranium bulls think that uranium prices might go much higher than $65/lb and maybe reach even higher than they did in 2007. In any case, there is money to be made in the next few years in uranium.

Risks: 1, another Chernobyl or Fukushima would of course be bad news for the entire sector. However, the existing power plants still need uranium and the current uranium price is still too low, so it is possible that some gains will be maintained even with a bad accident; 2, Increased number of plants retiring. Some countries, e.g. Germany, are retiring all their nuclear power plants. If more countries follow suit it will over time reduce demand; 3, In theory it might be possible for producers to pick up the slack faster than expected and reduce the supply shortage and put a damper on the rise in the uranium price. So far, this does not seem to be the case, but even the low cost producers are limiting their production, and new or mothballed mines take time and resources to get up and running.
So, while there are risks, I think there is more than a good chance that we will see at least a doubling of the uranium price. 

This is obviously not investment advice, I don't know anything about all of this and you should definitely do your own research. Personally I'm invested in a bunch of different uranium companies: DNN, GLATF, CCJ, PALATF, CVVUF, STTDF. And I plan to continue buying if there are any dips and maybe start buying into the Sprott Uranium Trust as well (SRUUF). Oh yeah, the plan is for SRUUF to get listed on the NYSE this fall, that should hopefully bring in a lot more money into buying physical uranium and continue to drive up the price."|0.79|24.0|0.0|24.0|['Kazatomprom', 'STTDF', 'SRUUF', 'GLATF', 'PALATF', 'Cameco', 'DNN', 'CCJ', 'CVVUF', 'McArthur', 'the Sprott Uranium Trust', 'Sprott']

**Disclaimer:** **I'm simply condensing some thoughts I've had on payment for order flow (PFOF). I'm just a casual observer, and this is the internet. For all you know everything I'm about to say is complete BS.**

Payment for order flow =/= front running (which is already illegal). Nothing I have seen or experienced leads me to believe that PFOF screws over retail investors in any meaningful way.

Might you get better fills if you use a brokerage that doesn't participate in PFOF? Sure. Does it matter? No, at least not for the vast majority of retail investors. If you're in that *tiny* (probably non-existent) minority where your bottleneck to greater profits is fill quality, then you probably wouldn't consider yourself an investor, and probably aren't reading this post.

Think about it: If you bought AAPL a month ago, does it really matter that your order *technically* might not have filled at the best possible price? What if you only DCA into SPY? If you were gambling in penny stocks or options having no idea what you were doing, is PFOF the deciding factor of your P/L? No. **Isn't it great that we can do all of these things without worrying about paying commissions?** I think so.

Even if you *could* get better price improvement from a broker not participating in PFOF, you're still never going to do worse than the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp).

It used to not be very clear to me *why* market makers are willing to pay so much for retail order flow. Then I read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxbzcx3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/hnkiaz/why_is_this_subreddit_so_popular/fxcfrlc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from someone who implies they are a market maker, and the light bulb went on. Here are the highlights:

&gt;...  
we literally buy up your order flow and make pretty good money off of it because you guys genuinely have no clue what you're doing  
...  
in aggregate your orders are effectively random noise that we can trade against to make a small spread  
...  
If I'm market making, I'm putting a bid at price B, and an ask at price B + S for some S &gt; 0. I am hoping that someone will sell to me at price B and buy from me at price B + S, so that my profit on such a pair of transactions will be S, the spread.  
...  
So anyways one guy, Joe, has his fancy indicator X signal to buy stock XYZ and shortly thereafter another gal, Jane has her fancy indicator Y signal to sell stock XYZ. The ad-hoc nature of many of these ""indicators"" is that most of them will not be correlated with one another and in aggregate will mostly average out to some fraction of S.  
...  
So if I know that there's a group of unsophisticated traders on stock XYZ, I want to trade against them in aggregate compared to trading against a sophisticated trader who may actually know what they're doing.  
...  
The remaining risk in the above strategy is that XYZ can have actual legitimate signals such as news that causes the price to swing heavily in one direction or another, so usually when market making you find a basket of stocks that are delta neutral.

This makes the most sense out of anything I've ever read about PFOF.

If I'm a market maker and it's *literally my job* to be transacting in the market *all day every day*, and my goal is to make money from the bid/ask spread, I don't want to be exposed to any other source of P/L. The best I can hope for is to take opposing trades to as many orders as possible whose P/L will average out to 0. I'll make the spread times however many round trip trades that I've taken.

Now let's look at front running.

Here's what FINRA says about front running ([rule 5270](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5270)):

&gt;No member or person associated with a member shall cause to be executed an order to buy or sell a security or a related financial instrument when such member or person associated with a member causing such order to be executed has material, non-public market information concerning an imminent block transaction in that security, a related financial instrument or a security underlying the related financial instrument prior to the time information concerning the block transaction has been made publicly available or has otherwise become stale or obsolete.

...English translation ([source](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/f4-433/mccann1.htm#:~:text=Front%2Drunning%20occurs%20when%20portfolio,same%20securities%20for%20their%20clients)):

&gt;Front-running occurs when portfolio managers buy securities in their personal accounts prior to buying the same securities for their clients, or when the managers sell securities out of their personal accounts prior to selling the same securities for their clients.

If I want to make money by front running, I want to see a lot of large, one-sided orders, and get in on *the same side* as those orders before they're executed (remember a market maker will always take the *opposite* side). When they go through, and the market moves to that side, I'll make money.

It seems like a bad idea to try and front run retail flow, given its smaller average order size and uncorrelated nature. Retail flow probably won't be moving markets in most cases.

Obviously the whole GME/meme stock situation might be different, but maybe not. Here is an interesting point that was made in [a thread](https://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=200252&amp;PageIndex=2) on NuclearPhynance:

&gt;I can't speak for GME, but in similar conditions, you'd really be surprised just how non-toxic the order flow turns out to be. Especially on a short-term basis. A lot of the real flow winds up being near random and totally insensitive to the spread, unaware of its own impact, and uncorrelated with microstructure alpha. Obviously, that's all great for market makers.

I will leave you with a link to [an interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mb1dx3/brokerages_list_by_payment_for_order_flow/) that outlines what brokers charge for PFOF."|0.59|19.0|0.0|19.0|['AAPL', 'FINRA', 'GME']

What would happen then, if that wasn't the case anymore, as in many frontier markets? Does long-term investment in stock still makes sense? Is index ETF still a good choice when the extra TER in active funds eats up the larger return? Or it's better to find less volatile forms of investment? How can it be that the large cap index is weakly efficient and shows signs of random walk, while the rest of the market isn't?

*Fulgent has a growing* [*genetic testing business*](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/genomics-stocks/genetic-testing-stocks/)  *for pediatric diseases, which management expects to generate revenue of  $110 million in 2021, representing a 201% year-over-year increase.  That’s a growth story investors should be following.*

*Fulgent  bought CSI Laboratories for its oncology testing and molecular  diagnostics, made a $20 million investment in Helio Health for early  cancer detection, and increased its $19 million majority stake in  Chinese joint venture FF Gene Biotech for cancer testing in China.*

*The  potential for multi-cancer screening is mind boggling — in both  financial and human terms. Based on a single liquid biopsy (blood test),  multi-cancer screening can detect dozens of early-stage cancers before  they spread and become harder to treat. Pharma companies are advocating  and paying for genetic cancer screening since it improves the outcomes  and will drive demand for their therapies.*

*Fulgent has proven to be a very capable operator generating* [*operating margin*](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/operating-margin/)  *above 60% and ending Q2 with $777 million in cash on its balance sheet.

### Methodology

For each stock from NASDAQ and NYSE scores are calculated for each of the following areas:

* Valuation
* Profitability
* Growth
* Health

The scores are calculated using the indicators shown in colored boxes  above. For instance, to assess stocks profitability, Return on Assets (**ROA**), Return on Equity (**ROE**) and **Net Margin**  are taken into account. The algorithm looks up the value of ROA in  every stock belonging to the same industry and compares it against the  analyzed stock, providing a final rank: if there are 20 stocks and 5 of  them have higher ROA, then the ROA-associated score is (20-5)/20 \* 100 =  75, meaning that the ROA is better than in 75% of stocks. We want ROA  to be higher than in the other companies; sometimes, however, we want to  be lower than in peers, as is the case with Price to Book ratio (**P/B**).  Then, the mean score across ROA, ROE and Net Margin is calculated.  Similar with Valuation, Growth and Health scores. The algorithm starts  with Valuation score, requiring it is at least 50/100. Then it proceeds  with Profitability, Growts and Healts scores, each time requiring the  score to be 50 or higher. Finally, for the remaining stocks the mean  value across all four areas of interest are calculated. Only highest  ranking stocks are the ones of interest and subjected to further manual  inspection.

t3_peimts|1630331945.0|investing|Somewhat crash-resilient asset classes|"I'm looking for diversification of my portfolio to be somewhat resilient w.r.t. crashes. As usual, I'm writing a bit of a preface before coming to the point.

As probably most investors are, I'm currently mainly invested in stocks, mostly several ETFs. I'm planning to rebalance soon, so I'm re-thinking how exactly. I'm -- compared to most recommendations -- currently a bit heavy on US stocks because it went so well in the last years so the position is larger than it was. I'm a bit heavy on Europe, but that's kind of on principle since I'm located there and like to be a bit Europe-heavy, and I'm certainly too low on rest of the world and Emerging Markets. I have a little bit in Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds, but that's not too much.

Now, everyone will agree at some point there will be a crash. So do I, but as everybody who is honest to themselves I have no idea when. Could be tomorrow, could be some point in the next year, could be in a couple years, could be in 10 years. I simply don't know, I'm not a fortune teller. If I knew when a crash will happen things would be very easy: Sell everything, go short, and buy again after the crash.

But what I do know is that when there is a crash, it's good to have some money to buy. I could set aside some war chest in cash and just wait. But that money will be slowly eaten by inflation and certainly not increase in value.

If I were to invest some of the money in other asset classes other than stocks, ideally some which would not go down the same as stocks in a stock market crash, I could gain some value, and when the crash comes just rebalance the extra cash I have there to stocks after the crash for added benefit.

If you think about it, that's diversification across asset classes. I've read a bit on Google what people recommend there, and here's a breakdown of possibilities, and my opinion on them:

* Government bonds (US and the stable European ones). The good news is they are not so correlated to the stock market. In fact, for the 2007/2008 crash, they've done very well. For the 2020 crash, they fell rapidly as well, although not as much as the stock market. They give some interest, but it's certainly very limited. Seems a bit better than just holding the cash, but not much. Also, if I'm investing in US government bonds (which pay better interest than e.g. German bonds) I have the currency risk. I could hedge that, but that would cost a bit of the meagre profit...
* Commodities/precious metals. I don't get that one. I understand that some of them might go up in a crash. But they don't generate any interest by themselves, it's pure speculation. An ounce of gold is just the same ounce of gold in 10 years. Under a lot of assumptions I could say that it might be a hedge against inflation and thus better than holding cash. But it's nothing that will provide any returns beyond inflation by just passively investing.
* Real Estate (direct investment). It's a shitload of work, it's very risky since it's hard to diversify unless you have a lot of cash to invest there. I don't want that.
* Real Estate (through REITs or Real Estate stocks/ETFs). Much easier to realize, but questionable how much it helps with diversification. The Real Estate ETFs all went down pretty much the same as the stock market last year, and while not many of them existed, the 2007/2008 crash was caused by real estate, so I don't expect this to have been very resilient (but I'm looking into whether the problem here is that weighting by market-cap might be a bad idea here...). This might be an asset class a bit more robust than the overall market, but I am skeptical. On top of that, I'm shocked about the dividend rates here, I expected a lot of them to be much higher. Adding a bit of that is likely fine.
* Tune weighting of industries/regions based on their performance in the last years. With that, I mean thoughts like: US stock market went extremely well the last years, so if there should be a crash, it has the biggest possibility to fail -&gt; have less US. Consumer Staples and Energy did worse than the market the recent years -&gt; more of those, since they won't fall as much in a crash. Tech stocks went exceptionally well, so they have the most potential to fall -&gt; less of those. This will mitigate the risk (although I'm skeptical on the Energy part), I guess, but also limit growth for the current market situation.
* Cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly high correlation to the stock market if I look at the charts. They crashed last year. Also, they're pretty high right now and their intrinsic value is a bit questionable. I'm not completely against investing a small portion of my portfolio there, but I'm not overly convinced of this. If they had a clear negative correlation, it would show that they are regarded as an alternative when the traditional market fails. But I can't see that being the case right now.
* P2P lending. I'm skeptical. It's completely unregulated, so there's counterparty risk. It's hyped a lot by influencers, which rings alarm bells. And if I look at bondora, which seems to have shifted the focus to their ""Gain&amp;Grow"" product, that gives 6.75% per year, but has a 1% withdrawal fee and a 400 EUR maximum investment per month, this looks fishy. This industry also had trouble last year, with withdrawal restrictions and higher default rates, so its resilience in crashes is also questionable. It's its own asset class, but lack of transparency and regulation make me be very hesitant here.

Mining activities can affect the environment and the communities in these mining sites, so I think mining companies should also prioritize projects that will promote responsible mining and inclusion of the local communities.

For instance, Newmont Corporation (NEM) has sustainability programs that involve environmental and social responsibility. The company has environmental standards that are designed to protect the environment and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate the impacts of their mining activities in the mining sites’ locations. They also involve the local communities, providing jobs and provisioning local goods and services, which makes them become an important player in catalyzing the economic development and social well-being of host governments and communities. They also have the [Global Center for Indigenous Community Relations](https://www.newmont.com/IndigenousCommunityRelations/default.aspx), whose role is to “to advocate for excellence in engagement with Indigenous Peoples, both within Newmont and across the industry.”

The company is very inclusive when it comes to the local miners in the community, and hired a lot of them, generating jobs for people. They also put a priority on using locally sourced products and services whenever practical, to benefit the regional economy. Also, the company has an environmental management project with the goal of minimizing the impact of mining on the environment. This is also more possible since the current president of Ecuador vowed to emphasize the enforcement of environmental protection rules and larger involvement from indigenous communities in deciding the future of mining projects.

Somehow, a lot of corporations feel less responsible for the damage they cause to the environment and to communities with their projects, so I think it should be the responsibility of these companies to change and be more inclusive and responsible.

But now I'm going to write a bunch of stuff elaborating on this point, as there is a minimum for submission on this subreddit. Please enjoy!

I am wondering, with great curiosity, if anyone here (or there) has tried online peer to peer lending services. I would like to know about your experience. Perhaps, if you were so bold, you may also venture to remark about your return on investments. Of course I do not mean to pry. Simply, I am l seeking for anyone (and everyone) with experience with something like Peerform, Upstart, Funding Circle, Prosper, Payoff, or any other similar platform offering similar services and potential benefits.

More specifically, should I need to clarify, what was your general experience with this investment?

How long have you held this investment?

Were there any major problems? 

Were there any surprises?

Were you filled with joy?

Or..

Did this investment break your heart?

And most ever importantly, and not to be forgotten, (as it is the center of the debate) I mean to propose once again and beg your audience and ask with great earnestness, 

Is Peer to Peer Lending a Viable Alternative to the Stock Market? 

Please feel free to further elaborate by agreeing or very possibly (although I will presume no more likely) disagreeing.

Perhaps we can even get a rousing bout of fisticuffs going here regarding one of the finer points you chance to provide. Of course, I mean this most figuratively. Certainly you are a person of great character and eloquence.

From what I can gather, assess, and understand, it appears that one might very well expect up to an 8% return annually on these such investments -or indeed much more! This sounds a bit far fetched, and quite frankly, dubious to me. 

There certainly must be some risk, or pitfalls if you will, that I'm not aware of or fully appreciating. Of course there is always the risk of the borrowers not repaying what was lent to them in the first place. I would think this would be of paramount concern. 

So if you have lent using this service, I ask you, has the issue regarding repayment and the potential for delinquency and/or if not down right dereliction of prior obligations, been of such a substantive issue that you, your person, have had to deal with negatively in any magnitude of order or capacity?"|0.47|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Funding Circle', 'Payoff', 'Prosper', 'Peerform', 'Upstart']
t3_peg3sb|1630322502.0|investing|Long term value/growth rebalance strategy|"Tldr let PE multiples trigger a rebalance into value. 

Thoughts?

Did some quick analysis on S&amp;P 500 PE ratio. Current PE is not a good measure due to 2020 earnings but the estimated earnings for 2021 are 205 which puts sp500 around 22 times earnings

I'll take 2010 earnings of 89 and bump it up to 90 for best case analysis. Assume way above average earnings growth of 7.2%. For 11 years to get us to 2021. How much am I willing to pay for earnings if recent average is 16 times earnings with 19 being the extreme? 20 of course. I'm a long term investor. 

I'll divide by 10 because I'm looking at spy. 

90×1.072^11 × 20÷10 = 386

Ok. We should be here. Earnings are much higher than expected due to the stimulus. 

If we take current record earnings with a 20 PE the extreme shouldn't be at 450 until roughly 2 years from now. 

End of this year plus 1.5

205×1.072^1.5 × 20 = 4,550

Here's the strategy:

When I see earnings multiple rise to these heights I move from something like SPY to VTV. Value. 

The percentages can be customized for risk tolerance but that's the general idea. Let PE trigger a rebalance.

An example portfolio may be SPY 80% QQQ 20%. Add to and hold for a decade. Notice the sky high multiples, move all QQQ into VTV. Move half of spy into VTV. Keep adding to SPY QQQ in the same 80/20 ratio even though you're buying high, doesn't matter. Hold and add for another decade and watch as PE come back to normal either through mind blowing earnings or prices drop.

Either easy you've protected your earnings and can weather a correction."|0.69|10.0|0.0|10.0|['sp500', 'SPY', 'Tldr']
